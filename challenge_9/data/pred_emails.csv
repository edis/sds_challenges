"FROM; MRS GRACE BOLA IGEGreetings,  I am making this contact to you on the fact that we may be of assistance to each other in developing a long lasting cordial business relationship, if you put your trust in  God that this will work out forthe benefit of my own family and yours.    I was moved by my personal inspiration to entrust on your sincerity to  handle a business relationship that involves huge money on trust. I was  constrained by the sudden death of my husband, the former Minister of  Power andsteel and currently before his death, the Minister for Justice  of my country, whom was assassinated by an unknown men. I am Mrs. grace Bola Ige, the second wife of the late Mr. Bola Ige who died on  December 23rd 2001. With heart full of grief, I regret to inform you of  the inhumane and harsh conditions which my husband's first wife and the brother's have subjected my two daughters and me. Since my husband's death,the relatives have been wicked to us because of the following reasons:1. I am not from the same tribe with them,2. My refusal to  learn and speak their tribal language and dress like other women from their tribe,3. My refusal to accept their religion,4. Because I have  no male child,5. Because I was specially loved and favored I am  absolutely tired of all these threats from my husband relatives since the death of my husband.I am no longer in their Family house. am now  in my husband's guesthouse, with my daughters, I seriously need your kind assistance and co-operations.Few weeks before my husband's death, he entrusted some security documents that cover a deposit he made to a security company to the tune of 25 million U.S dollars to my care for  safe keeping in my apartment in Abuja. After his death I acted fast  and required to gather information about the consignment. I was made to know that it was deposited as family treasure of a foreigner/associate  to be delivered on request. This fund was deposited for safe keeping with a Private Security Company. Now I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can come down to clear the funds in his/her name as the  sole beneficiary of the Consignment. This is so because of my status here as a widow of a political juggernaut. Now I solicit your assistance to accept this sum for self-keeping. This I cannot lodge into a bank account here in my name to avoid suspicion from the Government, my husband's brother's and wife since they have Confiscated all that is left by my husband and still places eyes on me if they could lay hands on more including cash as they have left me and my  children without any cash.If you can accept this, I urge you to  contact us immediately for us to brief you on arrangement on how we can  possibly handle this.This is why I honestly contacted you because investing this money abroad should be the best for my dauthers and me. I will be honored if I can be given the privilege of dealing with the investment proceeding with you.I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distress call to save US from a hopeless future. And if you agree, I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this regard with 30% of the principal sum. While the remaining 70% will be invested meaningfully for our future if possible in your area of business and different sectors of the Economy in your  country which are dividends yielding. Whatever your decision is please  reach me immediately through my email.And keep this letter tight secret  for the interest of my Family.I regret to inform you of the inhumane  and harsh conditions which my husband's first wife Justice Mrs. Atinuke Ige and the brother's have subjected me and my two daughters. Since my  husband death, the relatives have been wicked to us in my husband family.I hope to hear from you soon.MRS GRACE BOLA IGE"

"Dear friend,I know you might have received letters like this from the internet and it came to you as a joke or game, but this is real and legal of which I need your urgent response to. I am Barrister ALEXANDER AFADIA a Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney to Mr. Adams Kielar  a national of your country who was an expartriate contractor in the Oil industry. On the 21st of April 2000, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu - Lagos express road. Unfortunately they all lost their lives in the event of the accident. Since then, I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives but this was unsuccessful. After several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet to locate any member of his family but to no avail, hence I contacted you. I contacted you to assist in repartrating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Bank where this huge deposits were lodged. Particularly, the Bank where the deceased had an account valued at about US$35.5M. (thirty-five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United Stated Dollars) has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated. Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over three years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you are from the same country so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$35.5M. can be paid to you and then we can share the money between us. 60% to me and 30% to you,while 10% should be for expenses and tax as your government may require. I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please reply immediately if you are interested to enable us discuss further.

"From:Mr. Patrick K W. Chan.Good Day ,I am Mr. Patrick K. W. Chan. Executive Director and Chief FinancialOfficer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Col. Hosam Hassan who was withthe Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed depositfor 18 calendar months, with a value of Thirty Million United StateDollars($30,000,000.00) only in my branch.Upon maturity several noticeswas sent to him, even during the war which began in 2003. Again afterthe war another notification was sent and still no response came fromhim.We later find out that Col. Hosam Hassan along with his wife and onlydaughter had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit theirhome.After further investigation it was also discovered that our clientCol.Hosam Hassan did not declare any next of kin in his official papersincluding the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided inme the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of hisdeposit in my bank. So, Thirty Million United StateDollars($30,000,000.00)is still lying in my bank and no one will evercome forward to claim it.What bothers me most is that according to the la=wsofmy country at the expiration 5 years the funds will revert to theownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim thefunds. Against this backdrop,my suggestion to you is that I will likeyou as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to  Col.Hosam Hassan sothatyou will be able to receive his funds.MODALITIES:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that weshall come out successful. I have an attorney that will prepare thenecessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Col.Hosam Hassan,all that is required from you at this stage is for you toprovide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can comm=encehis job.After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will alsofill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and o=fprobate in yourfavour for the move of the funds to an account that willbe provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in this matter, as weare going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all t=henecessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion inall matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account weshall then share in the ratio of 60% for me, 40% for you.Should you beinterested please send me your,1,Full names,2,Private phone number,3,Current residential address.And I will prefer you reach me on my private email address below;(pkwchan_hk@yahoo.com.hk)and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of thisoperation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind Regards,Mr. Patrick K.

I am Barris=ter Kenneth Obi. I worked as an attorney to an Oil Servicing company {CEDRY= INCORPORATED} from 1980 to 1996 when the company liquidated. Cedry liquida=ted and folded as a result of mismanagement and feud amongst the directors.= On the 11th of June 1986, the company secretary and I took a LIFE ASSURANC=E POLICY for the Chairman of the company for a period of TWENTY YEARS, whic=h is from June 1986 till June 2006. This LIFE POLICY was taken from a reput=able Insurance Company here called STANDARD TRUST INSURANCE PLC. The premiu=m for this Life policy was paid upfront by the Cedry because it is a long-t=erm policy.</STRONG></DIV><DIV><STRONG>In 1996, Cedry was folded but Standard Trust Insurance Company= did not terminate the Life Policy we took for the Chairman because we did =not apply&nbsp; for cancellation or termination of the Policy. On December =2006, I got a letter from Standard Trust Insurance notifying me that the LI=FE POLICY we took for Cedry Chairman was due and that I should come to thei=r office for further discussions. I went to their office and they told me t=hat they have Three Million Dollars accrued over a period of twenty years t=o pay to the Chairman of liquidated Cedry as SURRENDER VALUE for the Life P=olicy the company took for him. The Insurance Company knew that Cedry was f=olded and they asked me to provide the Chairman or his relative to receive =the money.</STRONG></DIV><DIV><STRONG>Since 2006 till date I have searched for the Chairman without =success. I went back to tell the Insurance Company that the Chairman is ver=y old and senile to the extent that his sight is very bad and that he canno=t do anything for himself as he is almost a vegetable. The Insurance Compan=y told me to get any of&nbsp; the Chairman=92s relative with his authorizat=ion to claim the surrender value for him. I have resolved to get any person= or any person bearing same name as the Chairman to stand as his relative t=o receive the surrender value. If we don't claim this money,&nbsp; no one w=ould and the money would be retained in the coffers of the Insurance Compan=y as their profit. I feel it is rather appropriate that we team up and clai=m this money and use some percentage of it to help the poor and the less pr=ivilege in our society than allow the Insurance Company to retain it as pro=fit.</STRONG></DIV><DIV><STRONG>I contacted you in trust believing that you will not run away =with the money if it enters your account. The Insurance Company have very h=igh respect and regards for me and will be obliged to released the Surrende=r Value to whoever I present to them as heir to the Chairman. I will obtain= for you all that is required to execute this transaction successfully. I h=ave in my file some documents for the existence of the Cedry and the Life P=olicy. I will send to you once you indicate your interest. I will also send= a claim application specimen to you, which you will fill and send to the I=nsurance Company for the release of the surrender value to your account.

Photograph: Peter Muhly/AFP/Getty ImagesThe final part of the Northern Ireland devolution deal was put in place today giving the province its first justice ministersince the Troubles erupted four decades ago.Nationalists and unionists in the Stormont parliament voted together to create the new justice ministry completing the lastact of the Good Friday agreement.But there was discord inside the Stormont parliament after the Conservatives' allies in Northern Ireland the UlsterUnionists and their 18-strong assembly team voted against the move.Despite an 11th hour intervention by David Cameron imploring the UUP to vote yes the party refused to back the historicmeasure.The party's stance puts Cameron in a difficult position: he is in favour of the devolution of justice to Belfast but hiselectoral pact with the UUP risks exposing him to criticism that a Conservative government could not claim to be an""honest broker"" when there are disagreements between the parties at Stormont.Today's vote came just before 5pm when 88 assembly members from Sinn Fein and the DUP joined the SDLP andsmaller parties to back the transfer of policing and judicial powers to Belfast.But the UUP resisted pressure â from among others former US president George Bush â to support the measure.Speaking on the assembly floor Sir Reg Empey the UUP leader said his party had voted no ""as a democratic politicalto a friendhareendILirâ¢ontact user I smallerparty pledged to making power-sharing work in an inclusive manner for all the people of Northern Ireland and we exerciseour rights refusing to bow to the blackmail and bullying to which we have been subjected in recent weeks.""The deputy first minister Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness earlier denounced the UUP stance claiming it was intended toembarrass the DUP.""The UUP declared last night that they will not support this resolution"" McGuinness told the assembly.""That saddens and disappoints me. They are opposed in my view to the transfer for cynical party political reasons.""In a statement after the vote Gordon Brown praised the parties which backed the deal. ""Today the politics of progresshave finally replaced the politics of division in Northern Ireland"" the prime minister said. ""The completion of devolutionsupported by all sections of the community in Northern Ireland is the final end to decades of strife. It sends the mostpowerful message to those who would return to violence: that democracy and tolerance will prevail.""The courage and leadership of the parties who voted to complete devolution at Stormont will be noted around the world.""The Conservatives welcomed the vote without mentioning the UUP's rejection of the move. A Tory spokesman said: ""Wewelcome the fact that devolution of policing and justice is going to happen. We wanted all four parties to be involved andfor it to be decided by local politicians.""But the Liberal Democrats called on Cameron to ""clarify the position of his Tory-UUP alliance on the devolution of policingand justice powers"".Alistair Carmichael their spokesman on Northern Ireland said: ""With the UUP saying one thing and the Tories saying thecomplete opposite voters will struggle to understand what exactly joint Tory-UUP candidates stand for. What we're seeingis the Tories in complete disarray. When it takes George Bush to step in as the voice of reason it's clear that DavidCameron has dug himself a very big hole.""Carmichael added: ""This raises serious questions about David Cameron's judgment. If he can't manage to steer a straightcourse in opposition how on earth would he cope as prime minister?""Earlier there was acrimony in the Great Hall at Stormont when a victims' campaigner attempted to serve a civil writ againstMcGuinness.Willie Frazer of the group Families Acting for Innocent Relatives threw the legal document in McGuinness's direction afterthe deputy first minister refused to take it off him. Frazer is taking a civil action in Belfast high court against the Sinn FeinMP because he alleges McGuinness directed the IRA's campaign during the Troubles. The south Armagh unionist's fatherwas shot dead by the IRA.The FAIR spokesman said he had chosen yesterday because the DUP ""had betrayed me and other victims"" by agreeingto devolve policing and justice powers. Frazer predicted that Sinn Fein would exercise a major influence over the policeand judiciary even though the centrist non-sectarian Alliance party leader David Ford will be the first justice minister.Frazer said: ""I am very disappointed in the DUP because for years they said the things victims wanted to hear and nowthey have done a complete somersault. All along they told me that Sinn Fein would never get their hands on policing andjustice but they have a say. Mr Ford is answerable to the executive and that means the deputy first minister MartinMcGuinness. That is why the only action left to me is a civil action. I feel very let down by a number of DUP people.""The DUP will suffer at the polls for this U-turn Frazer predicted.rintable versionEmailCloseRecipient's email addressYour first nameYour surnameAdd a note (optional)[Send]Your IP address will be loggedShareCloseâ¢ Digqâ¢ redditâ¢ Google Bookmarksâ¢ Twitterâ¢ deliciousâ¢ StumbleUponâ¢ Newsvineâ¢ livejournalâ¢ Facebookâ¢ Mixx it!Contact usCloseâ¢ Contact the Politics editorpolitics.editorAguardianunlimited.co.ukâ¢ Report errors or inaccuracies: userhelpguardian.co.ukâ¢ Letters for publication should be sent to: lettersguardian.co.ukâ¢ If you need help using the site: userhelpguardian.co.ukâ¢ Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard:+44 (0)20 3353 2000o Advertising guideo License/buy our contentPoliticsâ¢ Northern Irish politics â¢â¢ Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) â¢â¢ ConservativesUK newsâ¢ Northern Ireland â¢â¢ PoliceMore newsâ¢ More on this storyâ¢ We will not be bullied says UUP leaderâ¢ Henry McDonald: Americans hold the keyâ¢ UUP-Conservative alliance: a risky strategyâ¢ Nicholas Watt: Cameron tempts Bush out of retirementâ¢ Editorial: The Tories and the peace processRelated9 Mar 2010We will not be bullied says UUP leader Sir Reg Empey8 Mar 2010rintable versionUlster Unionist party policing meeting with Martin McGuinness breaks down after three minutes13 May 2009Ulster Unionist MP will not stand as Tory candidate6 Apr 2009Northern Ireland first minister claims Tories and UUP colluding over expenses storiesEmailCloseRecipient's email addressYour first nameYour surnameAdd a note (optional)[Send]Your IP address will be loggedShareCloseâ¢ Digqâ¢ redd itâ¢ Gooqle Bookmarksâ¢ Twitterâ¢ deliciousâ¢ StumbleUponâ¢ Newsvineâ¢ livejournalâ¢ Facebookâ¢ Mixx it!Contact usCloseâ¢ Contact the Politics editorpolitics.editoraquardianunlimited.co.ukâ¢ Report errors or inaccuracies: userhelpaguardian.co.ukâ¢ Letters for publication should be sent to: lettersaguardian.co.ukâ¢ If you need help using the site: userhelp(aguardian.co.ukâ¢ Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard:+44 (0)20 3353 2000â¢o Advertising guideo License/buy our contentAbout this articleCloseNorthern Ireland: UUP rejects Tory plea andvotes against devolution of policing powersThis article was published on quardian.co.uk at 17.37 GMT on Tuesday 9 March 2010.

My father  was one of the most successful multy farmers in our country and =because he did not support Mugabe`s ideas, Mugabes supporters invaded his =farm and burnt everything in the farm, killing him and made away with a lot =of farming items in my fathers farm. Before his death, my father had deposited with banking firm in (Europe) the =sum of (USD $12 MILLION) for buying of new farming materials.But I can't =transfer it, to where i live becouse  I'm an Asylum seeker,and not allowed to =operate bank accounts, i want to go into arrangement by which i can live in =your country and get my money back for benefitable investments. I have agreed to offer you 10% of the total sum for your assistance as soon =as the money gets into your account also 5% has been set aside for all =expences onece the money is cleard,any expences  incured by you in the act of =claiming this funds and making the transfer to your account will be deducted =from the 5%  before  any other  step is taken.

" ATTN:DIRECTOR/C E O, I know you will be surprised to read from me, but pleaseconsider this as a request from a family i dire need ofassistance.First, I must introduc myself. I a MR. BALOYSITHOLE. from Angola. I am the first and only son ofBRIGADIER SITHOLE JONES. I am presently resident in SouthAfrica.I got your contact address from a business directory inJohannesburg Chamber of commerce and Industry. On behalf ofmy widowed mother MRS. ELIZABETH SITHOLE, I desided tosolicit for your assistance to transfer the sum of US$21.5MILLION( TWENTY ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITEDSTATES DOLLARS)inherited from my late father, into yourpersonal/ company's account.Before my fathers' death, he was a Brigadier in charge ofArms and Ammunation procurement for the Angola Army. In hisWILL, he specifically drew my attentionto the said sum of money which he deposited in a safe boxof a private Security Company in Johannesburg- South Africain a treasure box, fully documented in myname. IN FACT MY FATHER SAID AND I QUOTE 'MY BELOVED SON, I WISHTO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO US$21.5 MILLION . I DEPOSITED THEBOX CONTAINING THIS MONEY IN A SECURITY COMPANY INJOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA. DURING THE WAR, I WAS VERYDEDICATED AND OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONARIES WEREBUSSY HELPING THEMSELVES WITH GOVERNMENT FUNDS ANDPROPERTIES AND SENDING THEM TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES. DUE TOTHIS, WHEN I AND MY FORMER SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE PRESIDENTWERE ASSIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT (EDUARDO SANTOS) TO PURCHASEARMS IN SOUTH AFRICA, WE SAW THIS AS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITYAND DIVERTED THE MONEY AND DIVIDED IT. i GOT A TOTAL SUM OFUS$21.5 MILLION. IN CASE OF MY ABSENCE ON EARTH, AS ARESULT OF DEATH ONLY, YOU SHOULD SOLICIT FOR THE FUND FORINVESTMENT PURPOSES.'>From the above, you will understand that the lives andfuture of my family depens on this money, as such I will begrateful if you can assist us. We are now living in SouthAfrica as political Asylum seekers and financial laws andregulation of the Republic of South Africa do not permit usfinancial rights to such huge sum of money. In view ofthis, I cannot invest this fund in South africa, hence i amprepared to offer you 20% of the total fund, while 10% willbe set aside for local and international expenses and 70%will be for my family and me.Finally, modalities on howthe transfer will be bone will beconveyed to you once we have established trust andconfidence between ourselves.

"Hello,I wish to accost you with a request that would be of immense benefit to both of us. Being an executor of wills, it is possible that we may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations, when we cannot help it, or left with no better option. The issue I am presenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS. WEBSITE.http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm I am now faced with confusion of who to pass the fortune to.According to the English law, the fortune is supposed to be bequeathed to the government,if nobody comes forward as the next of kin within ten years of the demise of the benefactor of the will. My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the beneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the legacy of $7million, which my deceased client  bequeathed to his next-of-kin. For now, I alone know about his will, as my client had great confidence in me.Everything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for you and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the tsunami victims,as this is my primary objective. All I have to do is amend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the $7million legacy.Again, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider this amount too big for you to defend. It does not matter, as there are documents to back it up. This is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-kin. As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I prefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being disbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of the oath of the English Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the sensitivity of this issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its confidentiality. I therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with anybody, even if you decline my request.I look forward to hearing from you soon.Yours trulyPaul Spencer.     "

ebeigetu flork antes Just FYI. Palau UN Amb. Beck says you were friends in law school & thought yourecognized him when he came in w/Pres. Toribiong. Hope you're not in pain and mendsoon. JeffJune 20 2009The Myth of the $12 Million Uighur. By STUART BECKCONGRATULATIONS Palau. Our little country a group of islands 500 miles east of the Philippines has become if onlybriefly a household word. President Obama much admired in Palau asked our new president Johnson Toribiong to dothe United States a favor: Please accept as refugees a group of innocent Chinese Muslims. They are not anti-Americanterrorists but victims of human rights violations who landed at Guantanamo Bay for seven years. Innocent statelessharmless.President Toribiong a lawyer trained at the University of Washington and a highly regarded litigator told PresidentObama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that he needed to assure his people that the Uighurs were indeed harmlessand could be integrated into Palau's small diverse and friendly culture. Assuming that this due diligence broughtsatisfactory results Palau would be pleased to give the refugees temporary residence. Last weekend he dispatched anumber of officials to Guantanamo to interview the Uighurs and review their records.One would have thought that this positive gesture of friendship from a staunch American ally would have been applaudedat least in the United States. Instead for reasons that are beyond me unattributed leaks and unsubstantiated rumors havetwisted Palau's act of decency into another grab for dollars by a cunning third-world country. In breaking the story thatPalau was amenable to President Obama's request the Associated Press reported that two anonymous State Departmentofficials had linked Palau's acceptance of the Uighurs to a $200 million payoff.Almost immediately much of the news media took the bait did the math and asserted that Palau was getting nearly $12million dollars per Uighur. Within a day or two The Wall Street Journal was pontificating against a shakedown.Before the story gets too far out of hand let's consider a few facts. It is true that the United States and Palau have aneconomic relationship. Palau has been receiving American aid since it was wrested from the Japanese in 1944. (Over thepast 15 years this has averaged about $56 million a year.) This aid has come with strings; as the United States has alwaysinsisted that the Palauan government be ready to promptly turn over land for bases should the security of the UnitedStates or Palau require it.B6In 1994 the two countries agreed to a 50-year option that allows the United States to use Palau for military purposes. Thatagreement's economic terms expire in October 2009 and a new economic package for the remaining 35 years is in theworks â and has been for some time. But there has never been a mention of $200 million. And no one has even hinted atlinking the deal to Palau's acceptance of the Uighurs. The United States simply offered to pay relocation costs for theUighurs of less than $90000 per person to cover transportation food housing and medical help until the men can getoriented and get jobs.Palau is a small and peaceful community. Its constitution bans weapons of all kinds. Capital crimes are virtually unknown.Social life revolves around the family. Children wander from house to house. Could anyone believe that the leaders ofPalau would risk the safety and serenity of their modern Eden in exchange for money? Is it plausible that these close-knitpeople would countenance the presence of terrorists in their midst? I can assure you the answer is no.Last week the Palauans lowered their flags to half-staff in memory of Sgt. Jasper Obakrairur a Palauan who joined theUnited States Marines and died on June 1 helping to root out the Taliban in Afghanistan. He was the fourth Palauanserviceman to die in recent years following his fallen comrades in American uniform Cpl. JayGee Meluat Cpl.Meresebang Ngiraked and Specialist Philton Ueld. The people of Palau are very proud of them and of our country's specialrelationship with the United States. Can't Americans be proud of the relationship too?Stuart Beck is Palau's permanent representative to the United Nations.

"I am Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha, from Kuwait. I am married to Usman Isa Kaitha of blessed memory who worked with Kuwait embassy in Madrid Spain for nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years without a child he died after a brief illness that lasted only four days. Before his death he was a very devoted Muslim and I was a devoted Christian by birth battling with both cancer and fibroid problems. When my late husband was alive, he deposited the sum of $25.5million dollars (twenty five million, five hundred dollars), which he inherited from his late father (sheikh Usman Isa Kaitha) with an overseas finance and security firm. Presently, this money is still with finance and security firm. Recently, my doctor told me that I had a terminating illness (cancer) that would last for the next four months. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a Christian organization or a devoted Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in.  I want this Christian organization or individual to use this money in all sincerity to fund churches, orphanages, widows and also propagating the word of God and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of the holy bible. The holy bible emphasized so much on the giving of alms, charity and this has encouraged me in taking this bold step. I took this decision because I don't have any child and my late husband's relatives are all Muslims and I don't want my husband&#8217;s hard earned money to be misused by people that call me an unbeliever.I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner hence the reasons for taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with God the highest and the most merciful one. I don't need any telephone communications but will only give you the contact of my lawyer because he is the one who is going to assist you in making you the beneficiary of the consignment in the finance and security firm if you receive this letter and accept to assist me to conclude this transaction, if you want to speak with me he will arrange for that because my doctor warned me not to talk for too long a time and secondly, I can't discuss in the presence ofmy husbands relatives for they always stay with me in the hospital, my lawyer is the only person that knows the decision that I am taking.With God, I know that all things are possible and as soon as I receive your reply through my lawyer I will now give him instruction to make you the beneficiary of the consignment and all necessary steps to take before receiving these funds and I shall also give you the contact of thefinance and security firm I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original beneficiary of the funds. I want you and the Christian community where you reside to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted Christian though married to a Muslim, whoever that wants to serve God must serve him in truth and in spirit, please always be prayerful all through your life.

"Pinstripes to cargo pants -- Clinton tailors newvision for diplomacyBy Elise Labatt CNNOctober 27 2010 12:51 p.m. EDTSTORY HIGHLIGHTSâ¢ It is the first-ever undertaking for the State Departmentâ¢ Approach will focus on American leadership through civilian powerâ¢ Going forward diplomats likely to wear cargo pants as a pinstriped suit.Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is outlining how she plans to redefine U.S. diplomacy anddevelopment ahead of a top-down review which has taken place this year and will be released in the coming weeks.In an essay in the November/December issue of Foreign Affairs Clinton previews the Quadrennial Diplomacy andDevelopment Review commonly referred to as the QDDR. The review the first-ever such an undertaking for theState Department is meant to balance a similar quadrennial review by the Defense Department that projects theirstrategy and priorities.The new approach to development Clinton says will focus on American leadership through civilian power. BothClinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and have talked about ""demilitarizing"" foreign policy and Clintonsays the QDDR will suggest how to do that with a whole new set of resources for diplomacy and developmentmuch of which will be geared toward fragile states in conflict or crisis.In the article Clinton painted the broad strokes of the document which she called a blueprint for reforms to beimplemented over the next four years. Those reforms include modernizing and coordinating diplomacy across U.S.government agencies creating a stronger nexus between diplomacy and development and ensuring thatdevelopment undertaken by the U.S. has a lasting and ""sustainable"" impact.""Economic growth is the surest route out of poverty and expanding and strengthening middle classes around theworld will be key to creating the just and sustainable international order that lies at the heart of the United States'national security strategy"" Clinton wrote in Foreign Affairs. She said that the U.S. ultimate goal in development wasto ""put itself out of business"" by boosting up countries to assume responsibility for their own projects and future.President Barack Obama laid out the vision and the basic pillars of the policy in September at the United NationsGeneral Assembly when he released the ""U.S. Global Development Policy"" which changes U.S. efforts to focus onbuilding up countries that demonstrate good governance and economic potential.But the QDDR will outline how to put that policy into practice. Officials say the 150-page document will detaileverything from how the United States conducts multilateral diplomacy how the United States undertakes""stabilization"" efforts in post-conflict areas how the State Department works with USAID and contractors to thetypes and numbers of personnel needed to implement the new approach.American diplomats going forward Clinton said are as likely to wear cargo pants as a pinstriped suit."

This sum of US$11.183M has remained unclaimed ever since then and nobody has come forward as his next of kin.

"H: Pat Lang's view of the resumed talks. Sid.""IsraePaestinialpeace talks expected to resume in Se4zitember"" Washst""The Middle East peace process resumed in May after a hiatus of 19 months but it stalledagain over the terms of moving from indirect talks mediated by U.S. envoy George Mitchellto direct negotiations..israel insists it is ready for direct talks provided there are no preconditions. The Palestiniansare ready provided there is a clear agenda. Israel says an agenda means preconditions.Resolving the snag over terms is crucial diplomats say."" WashpostThe former NY Times reporter Judy Miller likes to address me as ""gloomy gus"" or some suchthing when I encounter her. Well stand by for some more gloom.The second Camp David talks failed because Dennis Ross and company placed thePalestinian delegation in a position in which a ""solution"" was demanded and expected by theAmericans and Israelis on the basis of bargaining during the negotiations themselves.This seemed reasonable at the time to the US and Israeli negotiators. After all is this notwhat one does? Should not the outcome be the product of the dialectic of argument andpersuasion?Arabs generally think not. They tend to believe that negotiations are for the purpose of ofarranging the details of outcomes that are understood in advance of the conference itself. Forthem anything else is an attempt to win concessions through trickery.""The Palestinians are ready provided there is a clear agenda. Israel says an agenda meanspreconditions.""Hello! What kind of nonsense is this? Have we learned nothing?And then there is the ""little"" matter of the non-participation of Hamas. Does the ObamaAdministration really think that this 600 pound gorilla can be ignored? Is this some sort ofscheme on the part of Natanyahu and ""the boys"" to discredit Abbas so that an isolatedHamas can be attacked and destroyed later?Realism in diplomacy is a desirable thing. George Mitchell used to be smarter than this. Hisstaff should be advising him not to do this. Failure will be catastrophic.All the players should be engaged and they are not. The outcome should be known inadvance and it is not.This is both childish and destructive. plhttp://www.washiLigtorsost. cortilwp-dyn/contentiarticie;2010/0811 9/AR201 0081 907203 htrni"

"I am Engr; Abubakar Saeed, the director of works FMW&H Nigeria and chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal government of Nigeria under the present civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones.I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction,which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of ultinationals in the Works and Housing sector in favour of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing (FMW&H). The original value of these contracts were delibrately over invoiced to the sum of USD$9.6,000,000.00 (Nine million six hundred united state dollars).This amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service law) from operating and/or opening foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this is enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in due course.Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the Central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that your role is risk free. To accord this transaction  the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval procedures will officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary.Once more I want you to understand that having put in over twenty five years in the civil service of my country, I am averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify your intention to assist by  you sending me a mail through my confidential email address so that I can brief you further (abu_saeed04@tiscali.co.uk).I want to assure you that this business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our home work properly. I quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are still in government service,which we intend to retire from.  kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the first batch which would constitute the first quarter payments for the 2004 financial year.Thanks and God bless.Engr; Abubakar Saeed."

Our investigations revealed no survival or NEXT OF KIN/RELATIONS for claims as we have long been expecting someone to forward applications for claims as it applies to our banking  regulations. Information / verifications from reliable sources confirmed that his supposed ?NEXT OF KINS? died with him in the crash. Hence this for your perusals.However, I kept this information (SECRET) confidential within my jurisdiction to enable us submit claims and transfer this fund through trustworthy person whom we shall present to our bank as the BONAFIDE ?NEXT OF KIN? to the deceased.

I will give you directives and all needed  information as soon as I receive your positive response.Kindly understand that we could not carry out this on our own as based on the simple facts that we are civil servants and secluded from operating foreign account and too, it will raise eyebrows on our side in terms of transfer being staff of the bank.

My colleagues and I has resolved to offering you 20% of the, total sum as commission, We will invest 75% of our share in your country provided it is profit oriented. 5% of the total fund will be set aside to re-emburse all expenses to be incurred in the course of  running this transaction such as telephone and other minor expenses.

I ammarried to Mr.William Clement from Romania who worked withRomania Embassy in GUINEE for nine years before he died in theyear 2001.  We were married for eleven years without a child. Hedied after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since hisdeath I decided not to remarry or get a child outside mymatrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husbandwas alive he deposited the sum of $14.5 Million in a bank inEUROPE.  Recently, my DOCTOR told me that I would not last forthe next Eight months due to cancer problem.Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to achurch,organization or good person that will utilize this moneythe way I am going to instruct here in. I want achurch,organization or good person that will use this fund fororphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavorthat the house of God is maintained.  l took this decisionbecause I don't have any child that will inherit this money andmy husband relatives are not Christians not even good at allbecause they are the one that killed my husband in other to haveall my late husband properties and I don't want my husband'sefforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation wherethis money will be used in an ungodly way.This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of deathhence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be inthe bosom of the Lord.Exodus 14 VS 14 says that ""the lord willfight my case and I shall  hold my peace"". I don't need anytelephone communication in this regard because of my health hencethe presence of my husband's relatives around me always.I don't want them to know about this development. With God allthings are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall giveyou the contact of the Bank in EUROPE. I will also issue you anauthority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary ofthis fund. I want you and the church or the organization toalways pray for me because the lord is my shephard.My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian.Whoeverthat Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth.Please always be prayerful all through your life. Contact me onthe this email address and any delay in your reply will give meroom in sourcing another church,organization or good person forthis same purpose.

"Dear Sir,First I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of itï¿½s nature as being very CONFIDENTIAL. I am a Senior Manager with a commercial bank . I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign country.THE PREPOSITIONThe late  JERRY ADAMS a Foreigner and an oil merchant / contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria until his death four years ago in a plane crash, banked with us  and had a closing balance of USD10,000,000.00 (Ten Million United States Dollars).The bank now unquestionably expect it to be claimed by JERRY ADAMSï¿½ next of kin. Efforts have been made by my bank to get in touch with any of the ADAMSï¿½ Family but to no avail. It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate JERRY ADAMSï¿½ next of kin (NOK) that the management under the influence of our Executive Director has agreed that since the incident occurred in 1997 and has left the fund dormant and devalued, we should transfer the fund overseas and utilize it either on stock exchange market or personal business interest.Your role is very important as the fund when concluded on transfer would be justifiably presented as having been remitted to JERRY ADAMSï¿½ next of kin (NOK)  . Your interest will be protected as unnecessary documentation will be avoided. Note that all modalities necessary for execution of the business have been perfected. The money will be shared equally i.e 50% for you 50% for us, expenses too will be shared equally .It is a risk-free deal. "

"MANCHESTER (WA) 20515  Greetings,  As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry forme, because I believe everyone will die someday.  Myname is Mr.CAMPBELL WILLIAM, from NEW ZEALAND, I havebeen diagnosed with esophageal cancer, which wasdiscovered very late, due to my laxity in carrying formy health. It has defiled all forms of medicine, andright now I have only about a few months to live,according to medical experts.  I have since lost my power of speech and can onlymanage to write now, as that has been the only way Iam able to communicate. I have not particularly livedmy life so well, as I never really cared for anyonenot even myself but my business. Though I am veryrich, I was never generous, I was always hostile topeople and only focus on my business as that is theonly thing I cared for  But now I regret all this as I now know that there ismore to life than just wanting to have or make all themoney in the world. I believe when God gives me asecond chance to come to this world I would live mylife a different way from how I have lived it. Nowthat I know my time is near, I have willed and givenmost of my properties and assets to my immediate andextended family members and as well as a few closefriends.  I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul andso, I have decided to give alms to charityorganizations, as I want this to be one of the lastgood deeds I did on earth. So far, I have distributedmoney to some charity organizations in UK, Brazil andIreland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly,I cannot do this my self any more. I once askedmembers of my family to close one of my accounts anddonate the money, which I have there to charityorganization in Bulgaria and South Africa, theyrefused and kept the money to themselves.  Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem notto be contented with what I have left for them. Thelast of my money which only few of them knows of isthe huge cash deposit that I have with my Bank inABIDJAN. I will want you to help me collect thisdeposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.waiting for reply.

"FROM THE DESK OF MR ALEXANDRE BIAISE.,DIRECTOR/OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN,CONTRACT AWARDING COMMITTEE:EUROPEAN UNION CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT.BURKINA FASO.WEST AFRICA.Dear Friend,I am Mr Alexandre Biaise, the Chairman of EUROPEAN UNION CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT Awarding Committee (EUCCAC) in BURKINA FASO West Africa.I got your information in a business directory from the Burkina Faso Chamber of Commerce and industries, when I was searching for a reliable, honest and trust worthy person to entrust this business with.I was  simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact from the directory. After discussing my view and your profile with my colleagues, they were very much satisfied and decided to contact you immediately for this mutual business relationship.We wish to transfer the sum of USD$36.000,000.00 (Thirty Six million United States Dollars only.) into your personal or company's bank account.This fund was a residue of the over  invoiced contract bills awarded by us for the supply of equipment,hard/soft wares, pharmaceuticals/medical items relating to constructing tool's, light and heavy duty vehicles, apparels and other administrative logistics etc for the Burkina Faso Projects.This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with all the attendant loop holes sealed off. As the Chairman of CAC, I have the cooperation and mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary of the Organization.We arranged and over invoiced the contract funds supplied by different companies from  different countries. It was our consensus to seek the assistance of a willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to transfer this money out of Burkina Faso.This is borne out of our belief in the non-stable and spurious political nature of this sub-region.The original contractors have been duly paid by the Bank of Africa Ouaga-Burkina-Faso in West Africa. (Bank of Africa, Ouaga-Burkina-Faso in West Africa).Through our bankers - Societe Generale Banque. This balance is suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company of our choice. We intend to pay out this fund NOW as the  organization is winding up its activities and the coast has been achieved.Based on the laws and ethics of employment, we as civil servants working under this organization, are not allowed to operate a foreign account.This is the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with your comprehensive advise, assistance and partnership in your country.It is however agreed, as the account owner in this deal to allow you 30% of the entire sum ascompensation, 60% will be held on trust for us while 10% will be used to defray any incidental charges and cost during the course of the transaction.This transaction will be successfully concluded within 14 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due cooperation. You should provide the followings;1, YOUR COMPANY'S NAME WITH COMPLETE ADDRESS,2, Your TEL AND FAX NUMBERS. (if available)3, THE NAME OF YOUR BANK,4, ITS ADDRESS WITH TEL, FAX AND TELEX NUMBERS.5, ACCOUNT NUMBER.6, SWIFT CODE.7, THE COMPLETE MAILING ADDRESS OF THE BENEFICIARY WITH TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.Upon the receipt of this information, the documents and approval with the  text will be sent to you for confirmation and then forwarded to the organization for ratification and subsequent payment.As with the case of all organized (sensitive) and conspired DEALS, we solicit for your unreserved confidentiality and utmost secret in this business. We hope to retire peacefully and lead a Honorable business life afterward.There are no risks involved regards in this business. I suggest you reply me back for more intimate and details discussions.Yours Faithfully.Mr. MR ALEXANDRE BIAISE._________________________________________________________________Don't just search.

"Greetings Dear Friend Please Permit me to contact you through this medium. I am Barrister Tunji Bello, a solicitor at-law. I was the personal attorney to one of my late clients that used to work with an indigenous company here in my country.In summer 2001, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in an auto-crash while on a picnic-trip. Unfortunately, all occupants of the vehicle lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to his embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives and this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to contact you over Internet. I have contacted you to assist in receiving and accommodating the money left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where these huge deposits were lodged. My deceased client had an account balance with his bank valued at about US$9.9million, and I have been issued a notice as his attorney to provide his next of kin or have the account confiscated. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating my client's relatives; I now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of my deceased client so that the proceeds of his account (US$9.9million) can be paid to you. You and I can then share the money 60% to me and 40% for you. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us seeing this project through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate/risk-free arrangement that will protect you and me from any breach of the law. I await your positive response to my private email address at tunji_b333@yahoo.com as soon as you read this email.

sbwhoeop@Wednesday December 23 2009 1:50 PMRe: any truth to this account? SidThe writer was not only a correspondent for The Guardian there but also apparently was on the Maldives delegationputting him in various rooms. The accounts from the conference have been very fragmentary the administration hasexplained very little (for whatever reasons and to its detriment) and it is being widely blamed internationally. The broaderlesson I draw from Chinese disrespect for the president (and US) on his trip (I've heard accounts from journalists) itsbehavior at Copenhagen mercantalist economic policy (eg currency) and its rough use of and contempt for internationalorganizations not to mention the strange form of Chinese neo-colonialism in Africa is the need for policy review. Fear ofChinese retribution (economy. Iran etc) can't be allowed to paralyze reassessment though it should be factored intoscenarios. The Europeans are being damaged worse by Chinese economic policy than us and China policy is a new areafor the Western alliance to consult on. Leaving it to Treasury apparently parks policy in a laissez faire twilight zone.Treasury has been as effective on China as it has been on AIG. Just thoughts of an observer.

"URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL Goodday Sir/MadamI am a member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II. It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by non-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims. The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant accounts - 54,000 in December, 1999. The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. Numbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that were interest bearing when established. The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE with a credit balance of 20,000,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest was discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs. The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died interstate (living no wills). Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch.we can share the funds and use in investment of our choice. Due to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds. All that is required is for you to provide me with your details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents for transfer of the funds to you. Kindly provide me with your full name, address,date of birth and telephone/fax. We will pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to a secure, numbered account in your name in Spain, of which you will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to your country and other banks of choice in the world. My share will be 60 percent and your share is 40 per cent of the total amount. "

"    DEAR PARTNER.I am  Sabastian Gomez. an auditor and accountant with a bank here in Afic=aNigeria precisely.There is a fixed deposit of =A315,000,000.00 ( Fifteen Million Pounds Sta=rling)made to this bank since 1994 which is ten years now and sincethen no claim or withdrawal have been made on thisdeposit. Fortunately, I have been the person working onthe interest from the day of deposit to date. Theinteresting part of it is that the fixed depositbelongs to the late John Hughe a forigner, a civil engineer by profession=.thismeans that the account may have beenabandoned by the surviving family members or that theyare not even aware of the existence of the deposit. However, I just finished updating the interest of thedeposit this october, and it has come up to=A337,000,000.00 at the 3% interest rate per annum. Itis this interest that I am interested in because Iknow very well that the family will care less on whathappens to the interest if they  want to redeem thedeposit, they will be interested on the main money,that is if they are able to claim it at all because allthe money lodged into different banks here in Arica are now been claimedby the Nigerian government.Meanwhile, my plan is to withdraw just some amountfrom the accumulated interest and transfer it to a foreign account. which=will not evenaffect the main fixed deposit. I will give you thedetails of procedure and my full ID when I receiveyour reply and indication of partner. Your reward andamount to withdraw will be our mutual agreement toavoid any misunderstanding.We have noting to lose, we only courage to do this.

"AN URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL I am pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and profitable Business proposal, though I don't know you neither have I seen you before but my confidence was reposed on you when the Chief Executive of Lagos State chamber of Commerce and Industry handed me your contact for a confidential business.

He has in his Account in my branch the sum of US$21.5 Million (Twenty One Million Five Hundred ThousandU.S.Dollars).Unfortunately, the man died four years ago until today non-of his next of kin has come forward to claim the money. Having noticed this, I in collaboration with two other top Officials of the bank we have covered up the account all this while. Now we want you (being a foreigner) to be fronted as one of his next of kin and forward your account and other relevant documents to be advised to you by us to attest to the Claim. We will use our positions to get all internal documentations to back up the claims .The whole procedures will last only ten working days to get the Fund retrieved successfully Without trace even in future.Your response is only what we are waiting for as we have arranged all necessary things.

"The President/CEODear Sir/Madam,It is indeed my pleasure to write you this business request which I believe will come to you as a surprise since both of us are complete strangers.I am MR. AHMED, ABACHA the son of the late General SANNI ABACHA former president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.In brief details, after the death of my father the government of Nigeria arrested my elder brother and kept him in jail being the heir apparent of my late father until he was made to sign an authorization empowering the government to frozen all of my fatherï¿½s account and seized his landed assets alleging that my late father looted the federal treasury during his tenure in office thereby leaving the family with visually no source of livelihood except for the goodwill we receive from family friends who appreciated the good and kindness done by our heroic father while in office as president.As if this inhuman act of the government was not enough, they frozen the account of my mother and restricted her movement even within the country. The family being faced with financial difficulties and having exhausted all avenues to make the present government return some of the money and landed assets confiscated from us, we launched a vigorous manhunt for any investment my late father could have maintained overseas directly or indirectly. In our relentless effort, last month we stumbled into a vital document kept in a little safe hidden in the basement of our house revealing that he maintained a private vault box deposit with a private finance and security firm in the Republic of South Africa. According to this document he has the sum of US$125,450,000.00 (One Hundred Twenty-Five Million Four Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars) in his vault box deposit which the security firm is not aware off.Therefore, in our bid to recover this investment, my mother request that I immediately travel to South Africa to hold discussions with the management of the security company to discuss possible ways the family can take possession of the investment deposit being held with them. It was on this premise I was told by the management of the company that the agreement entered into with our late father is that his safe box deposit will be collected upon his instruction by his friend in the United States. This we strongly believe he did for security reasons as the then president. The management had therefore insisted that for them to release the vault box deposit, my family must appoint someone who can stand in for my late father on behalf of the family.In view of the above, my mother have asked me to stay behind in South Africa to source for someone from the United States who is willing to assist our family which is in die need at this point in time.However, please note that this transaction is guaranteed, safe and secured.Please do not hesitate to contact me at once should you be interested to help my family. Also, my family has decided to part with 25% of the total sum for your kind cooperation and assistance. My contact me with E-mail,Best regards,Ahmed, Abacha"

From EUR:Update on Ukraine Election SituationWith over 99.9 percent of the vote in Ukraine counted Yanukovych leads by 3.5 percent(almost 900000 votes) and is the clear winner and next president. The Central ElectionCommission should complete its vote tabulation today and must certify the results within tendays; certification is expected as early as Friday. Tymoshenko who has been silent publiclyplans to bring cases of alleged electoral fraud to the courts but they will not change theresult. Tymoshenko claims that she intends to work within the law and not to incite streetprotests.Our recommendation isEU Ambassadors in Kievhave recommended the same approach to Brussels but want to revisit it if there is no progressby Friday. Medvedev called Yanukovych today with praise for the conduct of elections butstopped short of congratulating him on his victory.Following certification of the election Tymoshenko is likely to appeal within the legal five-dayperiod. This will likely push back an inauguration date until early March.

By tradition, all that my late husbandhad, [wealth] belongs to his brothers/family. Andmyself is to be remarried by his immediate youngerbrother which I vehemently refused. They have takenall that I suffered with my husband to acquireincluding treasures, houses and his bank particularseized by them.

"First observation: Bibi's Entebbe in reverse. The father Benzion Netanyahu 100 years old secretary to Jabotinsky anddenounced as too radical by Begin adored his son Yoni heroically killed at Entebbe. Benyamin has never measured up.Benzion has constantly criticized him in public for his deviations from the doctrine of Greater Israel. Bibi desperately seekshis father's approbation and can never equal his dead brother. See Benzion's most recent scathing undermining of his sonBibi and Bibi's tearful tribute to his brother just last month. The raid on the ship to Gaza resembles the raid on Entebbeexcept that there are no hostages no guns it's not in Africa and it's a fiasco; otherwise it's Entebbe. (Then there's EhudBarak reliving his youth as a raider killing Palestinians in Lebanon a feat memorialized in Spielberg's film Munich.Ultimately it didn't work out well that time either. The film captures the moral quandaries which appear to have escapedthe participants.)Further observation: The international press will inquire whether the Obama administration gave a wink or nod as theBush administration did for the Lebanon and Gaza incursions. Be prepared.Further: Of course the consequences for US foreign policy and national security are negative across the board: from theanalogy of the North Korean ship sinking and the Chinese posture to support for Iranian sanctions etc. etc. Did theIsraelis not hear Petraeus's testimony?Further: Of course whatever the outcome of such a raid one of the inevitable ones would be the death of the peaceprocess such as it is on the very eve of Bibi's scheduled visit to Obama which would have been under anycircumstance in light of the raid profoundly humiliating for the president. Or are the Israelis bone stupid? I don't think so.CheersSidLike Father Like Son? Netanyahu's Father Says Son NotSerious About Two-State Solution.July 8 2009 1 CommentIn a controversial interview with Israel's Channel II News the father of Prime Minister Netanyahu Professor BenzionNetanyahu says that his son does not support a Palestinian state. The elder Netanyahu claims that the prime Ministertold him he deliberately placed impossible conditions before the Palestinians.Here are excerpts from the interview. When asked if his son really changed his position concerning a Palestinian statethe 100 year-old historian unequivocally answered: (translation mine)""He does not support. He supports such conditions that they (the Arabs) will never accept it. That is what Iheard from him. I didn't propose these conditions he did. They will never accept these conditions.

One of his lessknown heroic deeds is his saving a soldier from across Syrian lines in the Yom Kippur War in 1973.Sirens will sound throughout Israel for one minute at 8 p.m. (1 p.m. EDT) Sunday night to mark the beginning of MemorialDay for 22682 Fallen Soldiers and 2431 victims of Arab terrorist attacks following the re-establishment of the State ofIsrael after 2000 years. Another 1500 civilians were killed between 1860 and the 1948 War for Independence whenseven Arab nations attacked the fledging newly declared state just three years after the Holocaust ended.On Monday morning a two-minute siren will sound at 11 a.m. (4 a.m. EDT).

"Dearest In Christ, It is with Heavy Heart i am reaching you regarding the death of my late client. I am Barrister Robert Beaud, the legal adviser to late MR. MIKE  & CAROL HALL, a very Wealthy Couple that lived here in the United Kingdom, before their recent Death on the 26th of December during the Tsunami disaster last year (2004).http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4153821.stm) these couple served God as very dedicated Christians,they so dedicated their life to God but they had no child till they died. They acquired a lot of landed properties like lands, Stocks/Bond,house properties, etc. As their legal adviser, before their death, the husband Mr. Mike  & Carol Hall instructed me to write his WILL because they had no child, they dedicated their wealth to God. According to the WILL, their assets should be given out to a ministry for the work of God. As their legal adviser, all the documents for the assets that are deposited with the security company are in my care. He gave me the authority to give out the funds to the Ministries for the work of God. As instructed by  MR. MIKE HALL before his death. As a matter of fact the total amount of money that is contained in the two trunk Boxes is $10,000,000.00 ,They did not want the management of the Security Company to know the content of the consignments, therefore they registered the content of the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the security company believes that what They deposited with them were Gold Bars. As a born again Christian,I have been reading my bible and I have to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God by giving out the fund to the chosen ministry for the purpose of God's work as instructed by the owner before his death.After my fasting and prayers Today, I asked God to make his choice and direct me to an honest Christian or the chosen ministry that deserves this fund by his Grace. I then came across your address on the Internet as I was browsing through a Christian site.I appeal to you for the fund to be used wisely for things that will glorify the name of God. I have just notified the Security Company where they deposited the consignments that contained the fund, that I am moving the consignment abroad, and the security company is awaiting my authority to move the consignment out of the shores of my country. Dear child of zion, if you know that you will use this fund honestly and wisely for things that will glorify God's name, then do contact me with the above mentioned information via (rbeaud14@netscape.net) Your prompt response will be highly appreciated. Yours in Christ. Barrister Robert Beaud. "

"Dear Friend,Please as you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Mr. John Naveed, a merchant from Dubai, in the U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with Oesophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.I have not particularly lived my life so well as a good person, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never Generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this, as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would livemy life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me and at the point of death, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close family friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul, so I have decided to givealms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deedsI do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizationsin the U.A.E, Malaysia and some countries in Africa. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do so many things by myself anymore.I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute themoney that I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, theyrefused and selfishly kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of elevenmillion dollars $11,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to various charity organizations. I have set aside some part of this deposit for you as compensation for your time and any inconvenience this will cost you. You can also contact me on mr_johnnaveed@yahoo.co.ukGod be with you.Mr. John Naveed"

"UUP policing meeting with McGuinness breaksdown after three minutesLatest row comes on eve of critical vote in Stormont assembly on transfer of justice powers from London to Belfastâ¢ Henry McDonald Ireland correspondentâ¢ quardian.co.uk Monday 8 March 2010 17.36 GMTâ¢ Article historyA meeting between the Ulster Unionists and Northern Ireland's deputy first minister aimed at securing the party's supportfor the devolution of policing and justice broke down in acrimony this evening.The encounter between Martin McGuinness and a UUP delegation lasted all of three minutes at Stormont.The latest row comes on the eve of a critical vote in the Stormont assembly on transferring justice and policing powersfrom London to Belfast. The UUP has indicated it will not support the last act of devolution because they believe the entirepower-sharing executive is dysfunctional.Sir Reg Empey the UUP leader told the Guardian last month his party would not support the transfer of these powersunless it obtained concessions on education â specifically the retention of academic selection to grammar schools at 11.Following the aborted meeting today the UUP released a statement condemning both McGuinness and Peter Robinsonthe first minister who is leader of the rival Democratic Unionist party. The UUP claimed it had been ejected from thedeputy first minister's office.A UUP spokesman said: ""An ill-tempered deputy first minister attempted to aggressively lecture the Ulster Unionist partyon policing and justice. He ridiculously accused us of being an anti-agreement party. Our delegation robustly reminded thedeputy first minister that we were the party which brought power-sharing government to Stormont.""Quite clearly dissent and disagreement are unacceptable to Sinn Fein â unfortunately for Mr McGuinness a party votingagainst a motion with which it disagrees is basic normal democratic politics.""The spokesman added that McGuinness's ""angry and aggressive attempt to lecture"" the UUP was ""wholly unacceptable"".""When challenged on his tone the meeting broke down. The UUP will not take lectures on our commitment to devolutionfrom Martin McGuinness.""If this is how Sinn Fein understands power-sharing then it is small wonder that the [Northern Ireland] executive isdysfunctional.""If the DUP and Sinn Fein press ahead with the vote it is highly likely that the leader of the centrist non-sectarian Allianceparty David Ford will become the first justice minister for Northern Ireland.The SDLP will back the transfer of policing and justice powers in the Assembly tomorrow. However the nationalist party isangry that it is not being offered the justice ministry. Under the rules governing the hand-out of ministries in the power-sharing government the SDLP are officially entitled to choose the next ministry.The party opposes the appointment of Ford as justice minister but will still support the transfer of these powers as theywant to be seen to continue to back the power-sharing arrangement.US Congress warns Cameron over danger offailed Ulster police dealYes vote on Hillsborough agreement would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next monthâ¢ Nicholas Watt chief political correspondentâ¢ guardian.co.uk Sunday 7 March 2010 22.12 GMTâ¢ Article historyUS secretary of state Hillary Clinton is said to be concerned at Cameron's apparent failure to exert pressure on his UUPpartners. Photograph: Karim Jaafar/AFP/Getty ImagesDavid Cameron has been given a stark warning from Washington that dissident terrorists will be ""emboldened"" to intensifytheir attacks in Northern Ireland and millions of dollars of US investment will be threatened if he fails to persuade theTories' Ulster Unionist partners to endorse the final stage of the peace process.In a sign of deep unease in Washington at the Tories' electoral pact with the UUP a bipartisan group of US Congressmembers have demanded Cameron must ""aggressively"" encourage his partners to endorse the deal in a vote in theNorthern Ireland assembly on Tuesday.""At this defining moment in the peace process it is crucial that all the political parties speak with one voice about theirshared future"" the members of Congress wrote in a private letter to Cameron.Without a unanimous vote they said the province's elected officials would be sending the wrong message to the peoplethey represent and to the world.""Dissidents are trying to destabilise the political institutions and turn the clock back ... These dissidents will continue to beemboldened if they sense there is no political unanimity on the way forward ... The challenge of bringing good jobs toNorthern Ireland will be made more difficult if potential investors do not believe there is political stability.""The letter by congressional leaders of the 41 million-strong Irish-American community has been passed to the Guardianbefore the crucial vote on last month's Hillsborough agreement between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists.A yes vote would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month in what the British governmenthas dubbed the final piece in the jigsaw of the 1998 Good Friday agreement.The congressmen and women whose views reflect the private misgivings of the US secretary of state Hillary Clintonwrote to Cameron after learning that his electoral partners in Northern Ireland were voicing doubts about endorsing thedeal. Clinton is said to be alarmed that Cameron has either failed or not bothered to warn the UUP of the dangers ofobstructing the deal.A Tory source said: ""David Cameron has consistently made clear that we support the devolution of policing and criminaljustice powers ... We welcomed the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein. The final details are for the parties in theexecutive working as a four-party coalition to decide. We hope that between now and Tuesday any outstanding issuescan be solved.""The Hillsborough agreement was brokered last month under a system endorsed by the UUP when it was the largest partyin Northern Ireland. This says that any change must have the consent of 50% of both the nationalist and Unionistcommunities and 50% of the assembly.Sir Reg Empey the UUP leader who was one of the architects of the Good Friday agreement will meet his party'sexecutive tomorrow night to decide how to vote.The deal could still be passed tomorrow without the support of the UUP because the DUP's 36 assembly membersaccount for more than 50% of the unionist bloc. But there are fears in Washington that a no vote from the UUP seen as amoribund force until Cameron breathed new life into it would destabilise many members of the DUP and underminesupport for the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers.US eyes on Northern Ireland in countdown tocrucial peace voteHillary Clinton the White House and Congressional leaders look for a yes vote in BelfastBy Nick WattGuardianFor a few hours tomorrow the United States will turn its attention to Northern Ireland. Democratic and Republican leaderswill both be watching to see whether all mainstream political parties endorse the final stage in the implementation of theGood Friday Agreement: the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers.Sir Reg Empey the leader of the Ulster Unionist party is meeting his executive tonight to decide whether to vote yes.Empey has severe doubts about the deal between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party. This would see policingand criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month â a key nationalist demand â in return for the long-standingunionist demand for a review of the way in which contentious parades are run.Intense pressure is being placed on Empey to fall into line. Hillary Clinton the US secretary of state who has taken a keeninterest in Northern Ireland since the peace process was launched in the early days of her husband's presidency spent15 minutes talking to Empey by phone according to BBC Northern Ireland.But transatlantic pressure has also been brought to bear on the other side of the Irish Sea. I reported this morning that agroup of bipartisan US Congressmen have written to David Cameron asking him to use his influence with the UUP whichrecently formed an electoral pact with the Tories to vote yes.The unease among the US Congress members is shared by Hillary Clinton. She is said to believe that Cameron would bewell advised to follow the example of John Major who was respected as an impartial referee.The concerns in the US will raise questions about claims made in private recently by William Hague. The shadow foreignsecretary is saying that despite their political differences he is forging a strong bond with Clinton.But all sides need to be careful. The Tories who support the deal between Sinn Fein and the DUP believe that ministersneed to be careful about frightening the UUP with too much political pressure. The government was this morningtrumpeting a poll commissioned by them which showed overwhelming support among UUP voters for a yes vote. But asSlugger O'Toole notes there is some debate about the methodology.""It almost feels like the government want the UUP to vote no so they can draw one of Gordon Brown's beloved dividinglines and say we are to blame for it all going wrong"" one Tory tells me."
I want to give job--is there a slot in WHA or S/P or elsewhere for her? B6Also it goes w/out saying that someone who lacks discretion is not possible.So let's wait and see who else Lissa turns up.

" Alternative Email:judeigbo@juno.com		  Sir,  Compliment of the day and how is life general with you? Of course it is my humble wish to solicit and crave your indulgence to make this project request for a joint business transaction which I hope will not come to you as a surprise, hence I plead for your pardon.   I am Mike Igbo, the manager of headquarter first bank of Nig. Plc. Lagos. I have an urgent and confidential business proposal for you.   On June 6, 1997, an Australian oil consultant/contractor with via National Petroleum cooperation (NNPC) Mr. Peter Bush made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calenderer month valued at US$25,000, 000. 00(Twenty-Five Million US Dollars) in my branch.  On maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarded address but got no reply after months we send a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employee (Nigeria national petroleum Corporation) that Mr. Peter Bush died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, it was clear that he died without making a will. All attempts by the Australian to trace his next of kin were fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Peter Bush did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his deposit document in my bank. The total sum US$25,000,000.00 is still in my bank as dormant acct. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian banking law, after five years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government. If the account owner is certified death and nobody comes forward to claim it.  This is the situation, and my proposal is that I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the beneficiaryext of kin. This is simple. All you have to do is to immediately send me the details of a bank account anywhere in the world for me to arrange the proper money transfer document. The money will then be transferred into the account for us to share in the ration of 60% for me 30% for you while the remaining 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred with here and there.  There is no risk involved. I am using my position and connection in the bank here to do all the document work for the transaction. We shall employ the services of an attorney to draft the will and obtain all necessary documents and letter of administration in your favor for the transfer. This transaction is risk free guaranteed. If you are interested, please reply immediately confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction could be most profitable for both of us. Please do not expose this deal if you are not interested because if you do, it will take me out of seat.  I am awaiting your urgent reply.

"Greetings from the beautiful land of Zimbabwe.I am Joseph Made of Lands, Agriculture, & Rural Resettlement ministry ofZimbabwe.As a member of cabinet and former stuanch supporter of President Mugabe'sgovernment I was opportuned to be in the know as to what led to thestruggle for farm lands and subsequent fall out of my government with theWestern world. As of today I would be more than glad if the case of whathappened can be reversed as I have come to see that it was all in pursuitof the selfish interest of one man, the president!After all said and done, it has become obvious that my president like anyother African leaders needed to make sure that he remains in power to notjust consolidate his fortunes but also to make sure that he bleeds thecountry to death by siphoning the money meant for developmentalinfrastrure abroad. Of course with the help of some foreigners who do notsee anythng wrong in helping him steal the country blind. I may very well be sounding like a disgruntled and dis-appointed personbut the truth is that he has shifted his gaze from the foreigners to hisown very people. He sees any suggestions or opinions that does not agreewith his own has been that of a sabortuer and the person therefore mustbe purnished. In other words, we the followers have come to realise thathe feels threatened by not just our presence but coupled with the factthat most of us are privy to what transpired and are very much aware ofthe movement of large sums of money abroad.As it stands now I and many others are of the strong opinion that sooneror later it will be our turn to be flushed out of the composition ofmembers of cabinet and replaced with loyals who obviously have sworn to a=noath of allegiance and loyalty via fetish and ritualistic methods. Thisbeing the norm does not appeal to some of us and therefore we are nowtargets to be dismissed/disgraced from service or face possibleextermination.I have contacted you on the consideration that I could discuss with youthe possibility of placing some funds with you for management purposeeither in your existing establishment or other venture to be undertakenafter due delibrations and under terms to be agreed upon. I will prefersthat this investment be made in your country if and when we have arrivedat a compromise.I sincerely appologise for writing you via this means even without priorestablished acquaintance. But I do beleive that as we get along you willcome to understand the reason for my writing through this means.I thank you for taking time to read my letter and hope that you willrespond soon with any inquiries that may help you decide on your next lin=eof action.Regards,JM.My Secured Email Address:joseph_m333@latinmail.com"

"Dear Sir My name is LOI C. ESTRADA,The wife of Mr. JOSEPH ESTRADA, the former President of Philippines located in the South East Asia. My husband was recently impeached from office by a backed uprising of mass demonstrators and the Senate. My husband is presently in jail and facing trial on charges of corruption, embezzlement, and the mysterious charge of plunder which might lead to death sentence. The present government is forcing my husband out of manila to avoid demonstration by his supporter. During my husband's regime as president of Philippine, I realized some reasonable amount of money from various deals that I successfully executed. I have plans to invest this money for my children's future on real estate and industrial production. My husband is not aware of this because I wish to do it secretly for now. before my husband was impeached, I secretly siphoned the sum of $30,000,000 million USD (Thirty million United states dollars) out of Philippines and deposited the money with a security firm that transports valuable goods and consignments through diplomatic means. I also declared that the consignment was solid gold and my foreign business partner owned it. I am contacting you because I want you to go to the security company and claim the money on my behalf since I have declared that the consignment belong to my foreign business partner. You shall also be required to assist me in investment in your country. I hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will not sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me properly, I expect you to declare what percentage of the total money you will take for your assistance. When I receive your positive response I will let you know where the security company is and the payment pin code to claim the money which is very important. For now, all our communication is by e-mail because my line are right now connected to the Philippines Telecommunication Network services. Please also send me your telephone and fax number. I will ask my son to contact you to give you more details , after i have received a responce from you. Thank you and God bless you and family. MRS LOI C. ESTRADA"

"John Schelpert who died along with his wife and other passengers in EgyptAir Flight 990 - October 31, 1999. Since we got information about his untimely death, the fund has been dormant in his account with my Bank without any claim, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased and the person must be a foreigner as indicated in our banking guidelines. Before our observation in this development, we discovered that the owner of the account died without a Heir/WILL hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after Six (6) years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury account as unclaimed fund. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and my junior colleague in the bank now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we do not want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. Meanwhile the whole arrangement to put claim over these fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place. Directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit from this great business opportunity. We could have done this deal on our own, but because of our position in this country operating a local account would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require foreigner as second party that will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a designated safe foreign account where he will need the money to be transferred into after due verification and clearification by the bank. May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is a successful arrangement, and as an insider of the bank I have the capacity to monitor that everything is smoothly perfected. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to your own share of the total sum as gratification We have agreed that 20 % of this money will be for you as our foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 5% will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 75% would be for me and my colleague. There after I and my colleague will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. This share of yours is negotiable as long as it is reasonable. Please, you have been adviced to keep this information a topsecretas we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages we shall agree upon. All other necessary information will be sent to you on your acceptance to champion this transaction with us. I suggest you "

"OML SA , 2nd Floor, Building 3,Grayston Drive, Sandton, Jo,burg,South Africa.Dear, I am Mr.Smith Anderso the Head of Audit Department, African Developemnet Bank,south Africa And for reasons which will become obvious to you as you read on, I obtained your address particulars from an Internet address listing. Please exercise some patience and read through my message. I have a very urgent and confidential business proposition for you. On June 6th 1999, a Crude Oil Contractor with the Kuwait National Petroleum Corporation, Engr. Ahmed Youseff Mustafa , a national of kuwait, made a numbered time ( fixed) deposit for 12 calendar months, value $36MUSD (Thirty six million United States dollars only)in my branch. On maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally, his contract employers, the Kuwait National Petroleum Corporation wrote to inform us that Engr. A Y Mustafa died on an automobile accident; that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin through the kuwait embassy were fruitless. I therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Mustafa had actively opposed the Government of his country kuwait, and was consequently driven into exile. My proposal therefore is that, I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Mustafa. It is not necessary to be a blood relation to Mr. Mustafa, nor have the same name. It is not also necessary to come from the same Country. I have worked out the modalities to achieve my aim of appointing a next of kin, and therefore also by this means we transfer this money total $36MUSD abroad for us to share. No one will ever come forward to claim it now, and according to South African law,after 9 years, the money will automatically revert to the Government Treasury if the Account owner is a foreigner, and certified dead, and there is no valid claim. This indeed, is the situation. The money transfer paperwork itself will include a certificate of origin so that the receiving bank does not ask questions or refuse the money as money laundering. Also, the paperwork will include proper certification that the funds being transferred are from non criminal sources. In short this will be a proper and legal money transfer and there is no risk!. Once you indicate your interest I will initiate the processing of the transfer and in about 14 working days the money total $36MUSD will be in your nominated bank account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. Looking forward to your urgent reply. Reply to this email:smith_ad505@yahoo.com Yours truly,Mr.Smith Anderso."
I just stopped at and no one was home so I'm heading
Phil wanted you to see before your turkish call.
"this matter and I also want to guarantee you that my partner and myselfare in a better position to make the payment of this claim possibleprovided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that ourshare will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as veryconfidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form ofexposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember onceagain that time is of the essence in this business. I wait in anticipationof your earliest response.  Yours Truly, ENGR. ERICK"

Another note from milliband that he doesn't want to send through the system.
"The following is from an observer who I think is right about the need for more strategy time which means we have tohave a better balance about travel time. I'd like your reactions. Thx.""When it comes to foreign policy all see you doing a great job. You must be literally killing yourselfâ I can see yourschedule is bruising. But you probably need more strategy time less events as the ultimate judgment will be on â¢whether iran nk get the bomb progress in Mideast success in Afghanistan Iraq. Obama's pause on Afghanistan goeswell with elite media and left that is against all wars but not with swing male voters who are defecting. And I think it ismaking the rest of your job much tougher because the delay in the decision is looking Carterlike to US adversaries â anydecision is better than no decision. But all roads likely lead to Iran and perhaps Pakistan rest is secondary at this point.That's my view for what it's worth. Take care."

Well as I thought this bill has legs and looks like it's about to start running. Also I thought the QDDR would be donemuch sooner than Fall. Let's discuss this weekend.
"  ACCOUNT.  My name is Mr.Jason Leicester and I work in the International Operation Department in a Bank here in London.I feel quite safe dealing with you in this important business.Though, this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However, this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated as such.      At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT MONEY FROM OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER, a program leader.Until his death,The Late Prime  Minister, Mr. Rafik Hariri, has a huge investment here in the United Kingdom and all over the world, as a matter of fact he has the sum of(THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) in his account here in London which he deposited as a family valuables.The family do not know about this deposit.I was on a routine inspection that I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that nobody will come again for the claim of this money. A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder,      Therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide all necessary information needed in order to claim this money.Hoping in God that you will never let me down now and in future.o.k! Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri (November 1, 1944 - February 14, 2005), married to Nazek Audi Hariri, was a Lebanese self-made billionaire and business tycoon, and was five times Prime Minister of Lebanon (1992-1998 and 2000-2004) before his last resignation from office on October 20,  2004. The late Rafik Hariri died on February 14, 2005 when explosives equivalent to around 300 kg of C4 were detonated as his motorcade drove past the Saint George Hotel i n the Lebanese capital, for more information please log on to (http://www.hariri.info/)     I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER WHOM I CAN TRUST, I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE AS WE DON'T KNOW OURSELVES BEFORE, BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE BUSINESS.

HRC: Back this morning from Asia.Congratulations on the speech. I think it came out great. And the reaction I have heard today has been verypositive.Let raise an idea about how you could present the arrangement on settlements that you are seeking with Israel asI understand it i.e. a moratorium coupled with allowances to complete a number of housing units. There aretwo ways:1. To describe it as an agreement explaining why the US has accepted an Israeli completion of ahandful of units whose construction already has begun. This raises some concerns. It wouldrepresent U.S. legitimization of some (however small) Israeli activity in the West Bank and itwould trigger Arab and Palestinian complaints that we had compromised sowing doubts aboutour effectiveness.2. The alternative would be for the administration to say:a. We have come a very long way as Israel has made unprecedented commitments to the U.S. in terms of asettlements freeze. This is a very welcome development.b. We did not achieve all that we had hoped as Israel intends to complete a number ofhousing units. We have differences with the Israeli government on this matter which wehave expressed to them..â¢c. That said we are convinced that substantial progress has been made that warrantsan immediate resumption of peace talks as well as Arab steps toward Israel that will helppromote a two-state solution.This latter option retains our credibility does not compromise our oft-stated position and allows us to moveforward.Of course I am around if you want to discuss.Good luck in India. They are very excited about your visit.Sandy

"FROM GEORGE DUKEPHONE +34 690 35 9947Greeting,This letter might surprise you because we have met neither in person nor by correspondence. But I believe it is one day that you get to know somebody either in physical or through correspondence that iswhy i am now in spain making this contart please  do call me on phone becaouse this isvery urgent business. I got your contact through some discreet inquire from the chamber of commerce and industry,you and your company were revealed as being quite astute in private entreprenuership.one has no doubt in your ability to handle a financial business transaction. However, I am the first son of His Royal Majesty,WIWA DUKE and the traditional ruler of Eleme Province in the oil area of Rivers State of Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in respect of US 20,000,000.00 (twenty million United States Dollars) which I inherited from my late father the money was accumulated from royalties rapid to my father as compensation by the oil firms located in our area as a result of oil presence on our land which hamper agriculture which is our major source of livelihood. Unfortunately my father died from protracted diabetes. But before his death he called my attention and informed me that he lodged some funds on two boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary status. The lodgment Security Code Numberwas also revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a reliable business partner abroad, who will assist me in investing the money in a lucrative business as a result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this is the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move this money from the security firm to any country of your choice for investment purposes. So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so that the funds can be moved in your name and particulary to any country of your choice where it will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had intimated the security firm personnel that the beneficiary of the Box is his foreign partner whose particulars will be forwarded to the firm when due. But I will guide you accordingly. As soon as the fund reaches, I will then come over to meet you in person, so that we can discuss physically on Investment potentials. Based on this I and my family have unanimously decided to give you 20% of the total money, 2% for charity homes and 3% for expenses, which may arise during the transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive. The balance of 75% you will invest and manage for my family. I hereby guarantee you that this is not government money, it is not drug money and it is not money from arms deal.Though you have to maintain high degree of confidentiality on this matter. I will give youall proof of deposit and existence of money once assured and fully satisfied with your capability and honesty. I hope this will be the beginning of a prosperous relationship between my family and your family.Nevertheless if you are for any reason not interest, kindly inform me immediately so that I will look for another contact. I am waiting for your quickresponse.Yours faithfullyPRINCE GEORGE DUKE "

"I am Hon. Mr. Hope Sithole one of the Personal Assistants to the young President Joseph Kabila of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), since he assumed power.Sincerely speaking, my agitation is real, and my word is my bond in this proposal. This money in question is part of the budget made by our President Mr. Joseph Kabila, in the fear that members of the United Nations (UN) could perhaps be mandated to offer their respective supports in forcing Iraq to disarm themselves. Eventually, his dreams do not match up with realities and as a result he (the President) started using the money on personal ground because nobody could question/probe his actions, as he believed.As his closest personal assistant and with the help of two other officials one of whom was the then deputy Director, Safety and Security Department, we were able to escape with two boxes containing the aforementioned sum. At present the boxes were deposited in a reputable Security firm here in South Africa and were registered as family belongings. We had agreed on the need for a foreign assistance with a legitimate bank account abroad, that will stand as, the beneficiary and partner as well in order to avoid suspicion, since we are existing as refugees here. Copies of certificate of Deposit as well as all necessary documents from the Security cc. are available for a hitch-free transaction.In addition, you are also required to come/send a representative (as far as you trust the person representing) to the Republic of South Africa for the purpose of the transfer, but only if, by one reason or the other you cannot embark on a Five working (5) days trip by yourself, according to the expert from within the bank. As things are now we had not really agreed on the actual amount that should be your remuneration for your kind assistance, which to us is no big deal. The crux of this subject in particular is the declaration of your interest after-which we enter into negotiations with you over the (percentage) issue. Other details of which you may want to know shall be discussed in due course.Please be kind enough to acknowledge this proposal by responding through the above E-mail address for a high level of confidentiality in this business deal.Best regards,Hon.

One of our accounts with a holding balance of Money Valued $22,000,000.00 (Twenty-Two Million Dollars) has been dormant and has not been operated for the past six years.     >From my investigations and confirmations, the  owner of this account Mr. Andreas Schranner a citizen of Germany who perished ina plane crash [Concorde Air Flight AF4590] with the whole passengers aboard on 31 July2000. And for your perusal you can view this web site:http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm and  since then nobody has done anything as  regards the claiming of this money because he has no family members who are aware of the existence of the account nor the funds.Also Information from the National Immigration stated that he was also single on entry into South Africa.  I have secretly discussed this matter with some of the bank officials and we agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. This transaction is totally risk and trouble free as the fund is legitimate and does not originate from drugs, money laundering, terrorism or any other illegal act.    The sharing of the fund between us, is as follows; 40% of the total sum will go to you for your effort and commitment to the success of this transaction. 60% for me  and my colleague's.

I know this letter might cometo you as a surprise but I honestly do not intend to surprise you. I writethis letterin respect of my intention to invest the sum of US$28M(TwentyEight Million United State Dollars) with you. <BR>I inherited this moneyfrom my mother. This money was got through the smuggling and sale ofDiamond and Timber when my father was the head of state. </P><P>My mother though not her legal wife used her privilege position toengage in the business of Diamond and Timber since she knows that hersurvival will depend on how much she can get out of the privilegesituation.</P><P>When my father was assassinated on 16TH Jan. 01 by one of hisbodyguards Lt.Rashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of some top armyofficers that wanted to topple him I escaped to South Africa because ofthe fear that I might be arrested by my half brother Lt. General JosephKabila the present head of state. Actually his mother and my mother arenot in the best of relationship because of who among them will be thefirst lady tussle and this ultimately affected us theirchildren.Considering the relationship between South Africa and theDemocratic Republic of Congo new government, my mother advised me to leaveFor South Africa for security reason, while the funds were deposited witha security Company in Madrid Spain. On getting to South Africa where Ihave been living since then as a political refugee I am seeking for areliable foreigner who can assist me in moving this money out for safebanking and profitable investment. Honestly I contacted you because Idon't want to invest this money in South Africa due to my status here as apolitical Refugee. And moreover I wouldn't want to take risk because thismoney is all that I and my Mother is depending on because My half brotherhas seized all my father's assets and money and left I and my mother emptyhanded without knowing about this funds deposited at the Security Companyin Madrid Spain so that is why I decided that investing this money abroadshould be the best investment for me. I will be honored if I can be giventhe privilege of investing this money with your help.<BR>In view of thisplight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to thisdistress call to save my mother and I from a hopeless future. </P><P>And if you agree, I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candideffort in this regard with 20% of the total money and annual 5% of theafter tax returns on investment for the first three years.

"From:Mr. Patrick K W. Chan.Good Day ,I am Mr. Patrick K. W. Chan. Executive Director and Chief FinancialOfficer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Col. Hosam Hassan who was withthe Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed depositfor 18 calendar months, with a value of Thirty Million United StateDollars($30,000,000.00) only in my branch.Upon maturity several noticeswas sent to him, even during the war which began in 2003. Again afterthe war another notification was sent and still no response came fromhim.We later find out that Col. Hosam Hassan along with his wife and onlydaughter had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit theirhome.After further investigation it was also discovered that our clientCol.Hosam Hassan did not declare any next of kin in his official papersincluding the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided inme the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of hisdeposit in my bank. So, Thirty Million United StateDollars($30,000,000.00)is still lying in my bank and no one will evercome forward to claim it.What bothers me most is that according to the lawsofmy country at the expiration 5 years the funds will revert to theownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim thefunds. Against this backdrop,my suggestion to you is that I will likeyou as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to  Col.Hosam Hassan sothatyou will be able to receive his funds.MODALITIES:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that weshall come out successful. I have an attorney that will prepare thenecessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Col.Hosam Hassan,all that is required from you at this stage is for you toprovide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commencehis job.After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will alsofill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and ofprobate in yourfavour for the move of the funds to an account that willbe provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in this matter, as weare going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all thenecessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion inall matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account weshall then share in the ratio of 60% for me, 40% for you.Should you beinterested please send me your,1,Full names,2,Private phone number,3,Current residential address.And I will prefer you reach me on my private email address below;(pkwchan_hk@yahoo.com.hk)and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of thisoperation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind Regards,Mr. Patrick K.

I addressed this with Lippert when we last had an issue.Our identified point of contact is Sarah Farnsworth and we talk to her regularly. I will call and find out what happenedbut this meeting was confirmed. They are not telling us when things get canceled and I think we need another contactthere if sarah is too overwhelmed.
Another report--SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council as well as the highest levels ofEuropean Governments and Western Intelligence and security services.1. As of the morning of July 6 an individual with access to the information stated in confidence that Libyan NationalTransitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil remains committed to a transfer of power to a popularly electedgovernment; however he is prepared to ex-tend the life of the NTC as a guarantor of stability for the Libyan peoplefollowing the July 7 2012 election for seats in a 200-member General National Congress (GNC). Jaifi realizes that 2.7million Libyans have registered to vote and are generally anxious to replace the increasingly unpopular NTC. That saidJAI expects the voting to lead to a period of confusion and he will not abandon his authority until the results are fixed.2. Jalil is also frustrated by the fact that during its eight-month tenure of the administration of Prime Minister AbclelRahman el-Keib - who was appointed by the NTC was unable to provide solutions for Libya's long list of needs: afunctioning justice system a reconciliation process for officials who served the old administration the disarming ofmilitia building functional national security forces rebuilding destroyed areas and delivering basic services such ashealthcare.3. At the same time outside of the oil sector much of Libya's economy is stagnant and in the opinion of Westernsecurity officials lacks the government's go-ahead to restart public sector infrastructure contracts. In additioninternational advisers and foreign investors are reluctant to return to an environment where the government will notsign long term agreements and cannot guarantee security.4.(Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source Jalil continues to believe that this chaotic situationshould not be surprising. He regularly points out that eight months is not a sufficient amount of time to build functioninginstitutions from the remnants of the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. The old regime featured adysfunctional bureaucracy idiosyncratic rule and anti-institutionalism. Additionally Jaill now reIalizes that due topronounced incompetence and a lack of will to take unpopular decisions the el-Keib government also failed to makeprogress in the few areas where it could have achieved meaningful change. The towns of Sirte and Tawargha arerepresentative of the situation in the countryside where people lost their homes in the conflict and have been living intemporary camps with limited ability to register and vote in their home district. Jalil has been urged by contacts in theFrench and Italian Governments to guarantee the rights of people across the country in particular he has seriousconcerns as to whether or not supporters of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi in his hometown of Sirte will beincluded in the future political processes of the new Libya; if they are not allowed to vote by local militiamen. At thesame time the fighting between Libyan Arabs and Tebta tribesmen in the Kufra area threatens to prevent any votingthere. Jalil has been warned that the NTC regulations now state that members of the National Army are not allowed tovote or run for office which is a disincentive for armed militia brigade members to become legitimate soldiers.)5.This well informed individual believes that despite these flaws the new government created by the July 7 election willeventually have the mandate to take the difficult decisions that can create a reconciliation process. Jalil will work tomaintain order in this transition period and finally reach his goal of creating a situation where the government canrebuild homes and restore sufficient law and order; allowing those in Sirte Tawargha Kufra and throughout the rest ofthe country to live in their hometowns establishing a situation where a true civil society can develop.U.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739882Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Jail! in conversations with the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) and separately with liberal leader AliTarhouni has acknowledged that the central government's top priority must be security and that the NTC has beenunable to provide it. That said Jail! and Minister of Defense Ousarna alefuwali have pledged to provide 30000 to 40000security personnel for election day to prevent similar incidents to the July 1 attack on Benghazi's election headquarters.In that case eastern federalists entered the building where ballot papers were burned and ballot boxes destroyed.Similarly these federalist forces are suspected of the attack on July 5 that burned down Ajdabiya's main storage centrefor election materials.7. In the opinion of this individual although those responsible for the Benghazi attack were pro-federalist it has notbeen proven that they were members of the self-appointed Cyrenaican National Council (MC) whose military arm setup a roadblock in Wadi al-Ahmar on Libya's major east-west highway to demand that Cyrenaica get as many seats in theGNC as Tripolitania. Thus far neither the CNC nor any other group has publicly stated that they intend to use violence todisrupt the elections. (Note: Under the current system Tripolitania will have 120 seats in the GNC Cyrenaica (Barge) 62and Fezzan in the South 18.)U.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739882Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Also if done should include description and endorsement of Blair's personal Qualities foroffice. Can't be backhanded. Jonathan says Tony should call Bill soon. Sid
"From:Muhammed AbachaI wish to introduce myself to you and the reason for my reaching out to you. I am Muhammed Abacha the the son of the late military head of state General Sani Abacha who died mysteriously on the 8th of June 1998. Following the death of my father Gen. Sani Abacha,elections were successfully held in the country and a civilian administration was sworn into power with the assistance of the American Government under the leadership of President Clinton. With the advent of the new democratic administration, a decision was taken by the new presidentof Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo to probe and ultimately prosecute all past military officers and their cohorts that served in very strategic capacities in the last military regime of my father.I was among those singled out to to be punished after a makeshift trial,for the supposed deeds of my dad,ever since I have been in detention(the past 3 years).On monday the 24 September 2002,I was released,on the condition that I will release the rest of my fathers money in my care,to the tune of $I.5b,which I agreed. Now I have been released but kept under severe house arrest,I had amassed monies running into hundreds of millions of dollars stashed in various private foreign accounts around the world,most of wish have been frozen. Presently, I am confined under house arrest after my recent release from detention and I am now constrained into seeking for this assistance today because I cannot afford to let this goverment know that I still have funds stashed away. Shortly, before my detention I hurriedly deposited the sum of USD35.5 m illion with a security deposit firm for safekeeping,hence my seeking your assistance to receive this fund. I have since hadthis amount stashed away in a private security company in Europe. I cannot send this money to any of my Bank Account abroad or open a new account for reasons mentioned earlier.I hereby seek your assistance in moving and securing this money in your account abroad. I will adequately compensate you with 15% of the total sum for your assistance and co-operation with me to move this fund to your account for safe keeping where I can easily utilise it. The present administration has beamed their search light on any body remotely related to me and my family and you strongly know for certain that I am under surveillance and I cannot operate any of my bank accounts any more, due to their being frozen. I intend to safeguard and invest this amount of money abroad, but with a reliable foreign business partner so that we can invest the funds in doing business in your country. That is why I am soliciting your assistance and cooperation as regards this business.Arrangements are being concluded with the Security Company which has branches in Europe to receive the money in cash. I cannot tell the full story of my predicament on this letter. However you can get more information by checking the following web;links. http://allafrica.com/stories/200010230279.html http://:allafrica.com/stories/200012070247.html http://www.lagos-online.com/fg_details_loot_from_abacha.htm Please note that I have a relocation plans for me and my family immediately you have cleared and received this funds in your account.Please indicate your willingness to assist me by sending to me the following information, your private phone and fax numbers so that I can contact you and commence the transaction in earnest.

"Anne-Marie SlaughterSunday March 13 2011 9:39 PMJacob Mills Cheryl D; Reinesp@stategov; Abedin Hurtlepiece on libya nfz that will appear on NYT op-ed page tomorrowB6wanted to make sure you had a heads up. AMAnne-Marie Slaughter is a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton.By Anne-Marie SlaughterPRESIDENT Obama says the noose is tightening around Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi. In fact it istightening around the Libyan rebels as Colonel Qaddafi makes the most of the world's dithering andsteadily retakes rebel-held tow.ns The United States and Europe are temporizing on a no-flight zonewhile the Organization of the Islamic Conference the Gulf Cooperation Council and now the ArabLeague have all called on the United Nations Security Council to authorize one. Opponents of a no-flight zone have put forth five main arguments none of which on closer examination hold up.It's not in our interest. Gen. Wesley K. Clark argues that ""Libya doesn't sell much oil to the UnitedStates"" and that while Americans ""want to support democratic movements in the region"" they arealready doing that in Iraq and Afghanistan. Framing this issue in terms of oil is exactly what Arabpopulations and indeed much of the world expect which is why they are so cynical about ourprofessions of support for democracy and human rights. Now we have a chance to support a newbeginning in the Muslim world â a new beginning of accountable governments that can provideservices and opportunities for their citizens in ways that could dramatically decrease support forterrorist groups and violent extremism. It's hard to imagine something more in our strategic interest.It will be counter-productive. Many thoughtful commentators including Al Jazeera's directorgeneral Wadah Khanfar argue that what is most important about the Arab spring is that it is comingfrom Arabs themselves. From this perspective Western military intervention will play right intoQaddati's hands allowing him to broadcast pictures of Western bombs falling on Arab civilians. Butthese arguments while important must be weighed against the appeals of of Libyan oppositionfighters asking for international help and now astonishingly against support for a no-flight zone bysome of the same governments that have kept their populations quiescent by holding up the specter offoreign intervention. Assuming that a no-flight zone can be imposed by an international coalition thatincludes Arab states we have an opportunity to establish a new narrative of Western support for Arabdemocrats.U.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739568Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Daaider argues that stoppingColonel Qaddafi's air force will not be decisive; he will continue to inflict damage with tanks andhelicopters bombing oil refineries and depots on his way to retaking key towns. But the potentialeffect of a no-flight zone must also be assessed in terms of Colonel Qaddafi's own calculations abouthis future. Richard Downie of the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues that althoughColonel Qaddafi cultivates a mad-dictator image he has been a canny survivor and politicalmanipulator for 40 years. He is aware of debates with regard to a no-flight zone and is timing hismilitary campaign accordingly; he is also capable of using his air force just enough to gain strategicadvantage but not enough to trigger a no-flight zone. If the international community lines up againsthim and is willing to crater his runways and take out his antiaircraft weapons he might well renew hisoffer of a negotiated departure.If it does work we don't know what we will get. Revolutions are almost always followed by internaldivisions among the revolutionaries. We should not expect a rosy Jeffersonian Libya. But the choiceis between uncertainty and the certainty that if Colonel Qaddafi wins regimes acrosS the region willconclude that force is the livay to answer protests. And when Colonel Qaddafi massacres theopposition young protesters across the Middle East will conclude that when we were asked to supporttheir cause with more than words we blinked. Americans in turn will read the words of Mr. Obama'sJune 2009 speech in Cairo. with its lofty promises to stand for universal human rights and cringe.Let's arm the rebels instead. Some commentators who agree with the analysis above say we could'better accomplish our goals by providing intelligence and arms to the opposition. That would ofcourse be much easier for us. It undoubtedly appeals to Mn Obama as a neat compromise betweenthe desire to help the protesters and the desire not to overrule his defense secretary's reluctance toparticipate in a no-flight zone. But we would be providing arms not to a disciplined military but toragged groups of brave volunteers who barely know how to use the weapons they have. They needaction that will change the situation on. the ground for Colonel Qaddafi as well as his the calculations.Moreover by the time arms and intelligence could take effect it is quite likely that Colonel Qaddafiwill have retaken or at least besieged .Benghazi the opposition stronghold.The United States should immediately ask the Security Council to authorize a no-flight zOne andmake clear to Russia and China that if they block the resolution the blood of the Libyan oppositionwill be on their hands. We should push them at least to abstain and bring the issue to a vote as soon aspossible. If we get a resolution we should work with the Arab League to quickly assemble aninternational coalition to impose the no-flight zone. If the Security Council fails toact then we shouldrecognize the opposition Interim National Council as the legitimate Libyan government as France hasdone and work with the Arab League to give the council any assistance it requests:U.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739568Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

"<P><BR>Dear Sir, </P><BR><BR><BR><P>I am DR KABO HAMMED</P><BR><BR><BR><P>I have urgent and very confidential business<BR>proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an American oil<BR>consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National<BR>Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered<BR>time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months,<BR>valued at US$41,500,000.00 (Forty-one Million, five<BR>hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity,<BR>I sent a routine notification to his forwarding<BR>address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a<BR>reminder and finally we discovered from his contract <BR>employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation<BR>that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident <BR>with his family along Benin/Shagamu Express Way. On <BR>further investigation, I found out that he did not <BR>leave a WILL and allattempts to trace his next of kin <BR>were fruitless. </P><BR><BR><BR><P>I therefore made further investigation and discovered <BR>that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin n<BR>all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit<BR>paperwork. This sum of US$41,500,000.00 is still<BR>sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled<BR>over with the principal sum at the end of each year.<BR>No one will come forward to claim it. <BR>According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5<BR>(five) years, the money will revert to the ownership<BR>of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim<BR>the funds. </P><BR><BR><BR><P>Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a<BR>foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry<BR>Kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will<BR>not get into the hands of some corrupt officials.<BR>This is simple, I will like you to provide me<BR>immediately with your full names and address so that<BR>the attorney will prepare the necessary documents <BR>and affidavits, which will put you in place as the<BR>next of kin.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>We shall employ the services of two attorneys for<BR>drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the<BR>necessary documents and letter of<BR>probate/administration in your favor the transfer. A<BR>bank account in any part of the world, which you<BR>provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this<BR>money to you as the beneficiaryext of kin. The money<BR>will be paid into your account for us to share in the<BR>ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. </P><BR><BR><BR><P>There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this<BR>transaction will be done by the attorney and my<BR>position as the Branch Manager guarantees the<BR>successful execution of this transaction.<BR>If you are interested, please reply immediately via<BR>email. Upon your response, I shall then provide you<BR>with more details and relevant documents that will<BR>help you Understand. please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest<BR>assured that this transaction would be most profitable<BR>for both of us because I shall require your assistance<BR>to invest my share in your country. </P><BR><BR><BR><P>Awaiting your urgent reply via <A href=""mailto:email:dr_kabortsb@yahoo.com"">email:dr_kabortsb@yahoo.com</A></P><BR><BR><BR><P>Thanks and regards<BR>&nbsp;<BR>DR KABO HAMMED<BR>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P><BR>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P><BR><BR><BR><P>&nbsp;</P>------=_Part_2967_17616563.1070204591974--"

"(STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL)FROM THE DESK OF ( MR. MOHAME KABIRO)AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT /FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B)OUAGADOUGOU -BFREQUEST FOR THE URGENT TRANSFER OF THE SUM (US$10.5million) ONLY INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.You may be surprise to receive this message from me since you don't know me in person, but for the purpose of introduction., I got your impressive information through an international business equiry .But I respectfully insist you read crefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial reward for both us.This business transaction might not fall within the wide spectrum of your business activities ,but I plead your assistance ,as your flair for profitable business is needed .Permit me to introduce myself. I am MR. MOHAME KABIRO. the Manager of auditing and accounting unit at the foreign remittance department of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK . In My department I discovered an abandoned sum of$ 10.5m US dollars . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in november 2002 in a plane crash.Since I got information about his death, I have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because wecannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased anindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately I learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongsidewith him at the planecrash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased forsafety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don?t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned bythe fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.I agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, inrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 %will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me .

"Greetings, My name is Rabi Al salih, wife of MAHAMMED MAHDI AL SALIH,the former Iraqi minister for Interior Affairs. I got your email address through the internet while searching for a reliable person to help me and I believe you can be able to help me and my family. My husband was captured on 23 April 2003 by the US forces. My husband is presently in jail and facing trial on charges of terrorism, corruption, embezzlement and the mysterious charge of plunder which might lead to death sentence. During my husband's regime as Minister for Interior, I realized some reasonable amount of money from various deals that I successfully executed. I have plans to invest this money for my children's future on real estate and industrial production. My husband is not aware of this because I wish to do it secretly for now. Before the US invaded our nation, I secretly siphoned the sum of $12,000,000 million USD out of Iraq and deposited the money with a security firm that transports valuable goods and consignments through diplomatic means. I also declared that the consignment was solid gold belonging to my foreign business partner. I am contacting you because I want you to go to the security company and claim the money on my behalf since I have declared that the consignment belong to my foreign business partner. You shall also be required to assist me in investment in your country. I trust you as a reliable person who will not sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me properly I expect you to declare what percentage of the total money you will take for your assistance. when I receive your positve response I will give you all the necessary informations to enable you proceed to the security company and claim the money. I shall also let you know where the security company is and the consignment pin code to claim the consignment, which is very important. I assure you 100% safety and success once you follow my instructions.For now, let all our communication be by e-mail because my line are tight now connected to the US Forces Telecomunication Network services. Please also send me your telephone and fax number. I will give more details when I receive your reply.Yours Sincerely,Rabi."
Later is fine.

"PRIVATEDear sir/Madam,I am Ben Maluleke, a Native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an director and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty-Seven Million, One Hundred Thousand united states dollars (US$27,100,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and co-operation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf into a reliable company/individual account depending on your convenience.More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance the whole transaction. This amount (US$27.1m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor,leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key Tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% of the US$27.1 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction.I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my secured tel/fax number whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me contact other foreign partner with recommendation to carry out this deal. I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and Please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matterbecause we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business."

"Dear Friend,I am Bill Franklyn,a Financial Consultant Account portfolio manager based and working in London UK, working in one of the leading finance houses and I happen to have managed a particular  account for a Resident Foreigner,here in the United Kingdom,who died Interstate, leaving in our care a sizeable amount in a domiciliary United States Dollars Investment Account.For some reasons this client does not have an easily identifiable next of Kin and I have made several enquiries to locate any of my clients relatives; immediate and extended, this has proved unsuccessful, hence  I am contacting you ""based on the fact that you have similar names"". I need your assistance in securing the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Finance House here in the United Kingdom. The Finance House has already issued a Government Mandatory formality notice to provide the Next of Kin or have the account confiscated and this should expire within a month.Since I have been unsuccessful in locating any of his relatives for over two years and convinced that no one is coming up and having satisfied the mandatory  legal requirement of Beneficiary next of kin Notification, I now seek a Reliable and Trustworthy person,with your consent and perfect understanding, to present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of this account initially valued at Twenty One Million, Three Hundred And Twenty Thousand United States Dollars,($21,320,000) interest not inclusive, can be paid into an account to be provided by you(preferably) outside the United Kingdom Financial Institutions or its Isles), as the perceived Next Of Kin Legally and Otherwise.All I require is your honest cooperation and confidence in me; which I know would not come easy. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate background that will protect you from any breach of the law.I would advise that you give this positive consideration and get back to me soon. I'll be flexible and considerate in the percentage share that will be given to you for your assistance.Upon receipt of your response we will exchange contact information so that we can reach each other for further discussions.Regards,Bill Franklyn"

This sum of US$18,000,000.00 is stillsitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolledover with the principal sum at the end of each year.Noone will come forward to claim it.According to theNigerian Law, at the expiration of 6(six) years, themoney will revert to the ownership of the NigerianGovernment if nobody applies to claim the funds.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as aforeigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Trevorso that the fruits of this old mans labor will not getinto the hands of some corrupt government officials.This is simple;1. I will like you to provide me immediately with yourfull names and address so that the attorney willprepare the necessary documents and affidavits, whichwill put you in place as the next of kin.2,your privet telephone and fax number for rasycommunication The money will be paid into your accountfor us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% foryou and 10% for the expencis that we are going to makeboth local and international during this processofthis transacation.There is no risk at all the paperwork for thistransaction will be done by the attorney and myposition as the Branch accountant guarantees thesuccessful execution of this transaction.

"Dear Sir, It is with tears that I am writing this message to you from a hospital bed far away from my home where I have no mother, father, sister , brother or any relative, in the mist of strangers with a diffrent language that I don't understand, imaging how painful it is being a cancer patient. There is absolutely going to be a great doubt and distrust in your heart in respect of this mail,coupled with the fact that so many individual have taken possession of internet to facilate their nefariouse deeds,thereby making it extremely difficult for genuine and legitimate business class persons to get attention and recognition.   I am Mrs. Alimatu Branco. I am Married to Mr. David Branco, who worked with our Embassy in Spain for nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $18.5 Million with a Bank in Benin Republic Presently this money is still in the custody of the Bank in Benin. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem, but I know that my doctor is not God. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a Church, Organisation or good person that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. I want a Church, Organisation or good person that will use this fund for Orphanages, Widows and other peoples that needs help and also propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that ""Blessed is the hand that giveth "" I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians not even good at all because they are the one that are responsible for the death of my husband in other to have all my late husband properties and  i don't want my husband's effort to be used by those that conspired for his death. This is why I am taking this decision, I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. Exodus 14   Vs 14  says  that  ""the Lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace"". I donï¿½t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives are around me always. I don't want them to know about this development and I know that with God all things are possible to those who trust in Him. As soon as I received your reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank in Benin. I will also issue a letter of authorization to the bank that will prove you the present beneficiary of this money. I also want you, Church or Organization to always pray for me because the Lord is my only Shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve Him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayer f ul l through your life. Contact me on this email address and any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another good person, church or organization for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.Hoping to receive your response immediately,Please reply with this email I.D wasiutunji22@yahoo.frThanks and Remain blessed in the Lord.I remain yours sister in Christ.

Lissa MuscatineTuesday April 14 2009 10:58 PMSpeech DraftI'm faxing you a draft of the speech. It is way too long and something of a hybrid having started out as a bigpolicy speech in advance of the summit. Now it is a town hall one day before the POTUS outlines his agenda atthe intervention. My suggestion is that you review this long draft which covers a lot of ground (though noteverything). In the meantime I'll work on an abbreviated version that focuses on your main themes -- theurgency of our working together with other countries to narrow the income gap and reduce poverty by creatinga safety net of education food security and public safety that unleashes the full potential of the people andnations of our Hemisphere.

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.  There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals in the oil industry in favor of the (NNPC) among which were;  1) The expansion of Pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil and downstream products distribution and subsequent evacuation - US$2 Billion.  2) Contract for Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of various Refineries in the country.  3) The construction of Storage Tanks for Petroleum Product (Depots)-US$94 Million.  The original value of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced in the sum of Twenty Five million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars US$25,500,000.00) which has recently been approved and now ready to be transferred. However the companies that actually executed the aforementioned contract have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned.  Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount into your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/or operating foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust reposed in you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed amongst ourselves to offer you 15% of the transferred sum, 5% shall be set aside for any incidental expenses during the course of this transaction, you will then be mandated to revert the balance to us in due course.  You must however NOTE that this transaction is subject to the following terms and conditions; our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence, that you must accord this transaction with utmost confidentiality and secrecy.  Modalities have been worked out at the highest levels of the Ministry 0f Finance, Central Bank of Nigeria and the Presidential Task Force on Contract Payment for the immediate remittance of the funds within 10 - 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above terms.  Our assurance is that your role shall be totally risk-free. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves, and for mutual security of funds, the whole procedures shall be legally processed with your name or any company you may nominate as the bona fide final beneficiary.  Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 20 years in the Civil Service of my country, I am very much averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency. Kindly expedite immediate action as we are well behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the second batch of the 2001 fiscal year contract payments.  BEST REGARDS.  Dr. Edwin Useni. - Edwin Useni"
Yes. We are already working on that.
FYI. I'm following up with Kurt to get his thoughts.
On the first we have shared with them all of our intel on likelyRepublican votes. I think they know we are now well north of 67 votes. On the second we have confirmed with theparliamentarian that we can move from the treaty to the appropriations bill by consent or with a simple majority vote.So if we begin start on tuesday night there is a way to get both measures done by the weekend. We will keep working itwith Reid staff and floor staff over the weekend. If you have any reason to speak with Durbin (he's on sunday shows) orschumer I'm sure that would help too.

It is therefore upon thi=sdiscovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to makethis business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next ofkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursementsince nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into theBank treasury as unclaimed Bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remainedunclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Banktreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin inthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreignerand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, inrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside forexpenses incurred during the business and 60 % would be for me and mycolleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country fordisbursement according to the percentages indicated.Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you asarranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin ofthe deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number,yourprivate telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication andlocation where in the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text o=fthe application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that thistransaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom offear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.Trusting to hear from you immediately.Yours faithfully,MR.

The money was deposited in two sealed =boxes as valuables goods to avoid much demurrage from the security company. I =most say that the death of my father has warned me and my whole family not to =go back to politics.

As the eldest son of my father, I am =saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where =this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who =have tactically frozen our family wealth as I may not trust the system of =African government. Furthermore, the new Ghana government does not allow such =investment hence I am seeking for asylum. As a business person whom I must =entrust my future and that of my family into his hands I must let you know =that this transaction is 100% RISK FREE and the nature of your business does =not necessarily matter.Therefore, if you accept to assist me and my family, we are willing to offer =you 20% of the total sum for your assistance, 75% for me and my family, while =5% will be mapped out for any expenses that may be incurred in the process of =this transaction.

"Dear Sir, I know this message will come to you as a big surprise because we have not met before, but please do not think this is one of those junk emails you received in your email box this is for real. I am Rahim Sule I am the personal assistant to the late Mr. Alexander Murphy .my late boss Mr. Murphy spent all his live here in Lagos Nigeria. He is one of the richest contractors based in Nigeria before he died on 10th Jan 2000 together with his only daughter Kimberly in a motor accident. the reason I am telling you these is because since Mr. Murphy died, a lot of letters and faxes has been coming to me the personal assistant to inform the next of kin to the late Mr. Murphy for the collection of $15 million united states dollars (fifteen million united states dollars) which is his balance for the road construction contract he executed for the Nigerian government. But late Mr. Murphy has no next of kin; he died together with his only child Kimberly who is the next of kin. I lived with him for 20 good years and he lost his parents when he was a small boy. Mr. Murphy generation is finished. But nobody knows his history apart from me the personal assistant he told me everything about his life before he died. So this is what I want the both of us to do immediately, I will present you as the next of kin I have all documents and files of the late Mr. Murphy which will cover you up fully as the next of kin. The Contract Award Committee is waiting for me to inform the next of kin of late Mr. Murphy for him or her to contact the payment committee for them to release the $15 million United States dollars to the next of kin. Anybody I present as the next of kin the money will be given to the person joyfully with my approval. It is only I the personal assistant that can produce the next of kin. This is a quick and sweet business if only you will cooperate with me there is nothing to fear in this business since I am involved. The last letter the contract Award committee wrote to me yesterday was that if I cannot inform the next of kin, to contact them for the collection of the $15 million, that the funds will be sent into their government account and it will be used to purchase arms for their soldiers. I am just coming back from their office before writing you this letter; I told them that the next of kin will contact them very soon for the collection of fund. So I want the both of us to do this business together and collect the $15 million dollars when the fund is collected we must remove 10% of the total amount and give to charity homes then yourself and myself will now share the remaining equally 45% for you 45% for me. Please do not tell anybody what I just wrote to you for security reasons and for the safety of the business. Please if you will do this business with me send me your telephone number so that I can reach you. I wait to hear from you as soon as possible. Rahim Sule"

Longtime Clinton confidant Blumenthal to become Clinton advisorTue 06/23/2009 - 1:00pmLongtime journalist and former Clinton White House advisor Sidney Blumenthal will become a special advisorwithout portfolio to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton The Cable has learned. Blumenthal refused to comment.But sources say he is filling out the paperwork and disentangling himself from other obligations as he moves tobecome a special advisor to the secretary whose presidential campaign he helped advise. The position wouldnot require Senate confirmation.Clinton who is recovering from surgery to repair a broken elbow has been building her team at the StateDepartment while establishing her credentials as a team player supporting and amplifying her formerpresidential rival's foreign-policy vision. Sources close to her says she will prove indispensable to Obama apoint several Obama aides also made to Politico's Ben Smith in a piece noting the relatively background roleshe has played in these early months. The planned addition of Blumenthal a longtime confidant of the Clintonfamily and a fierce defender of Bill Clinton's presidential legacy could indicate she plans to raise her profile.(Blumenthal is probably Clinton's best speechwriter a friend notes.)In the foreign-policy arena Blumenthal advised former President Clinton on U.S.-British relations and firstintroduced him to future British Prime Minister Tony Blair. He has also been active in the Third Way-Progressive Governance process. A former Washington Post reporter Blumenthal has contributedcommentary and editorial advice to Vanity Fair Tina Brown's new online magazine The Daily Beast the NewYorker and Salon. Blumenthal has also been a fellow at New York University's Center on Law and Security.Laura Rozen I Permalink I fA9Ã§%'1 Comments? Login or register52

"Dear Sir, It is with tears that I am writing this message to you from a hospital bed far away from my home where I have no mother, father, sister , brother or any relative, in the mist of strangers with a diffrent language that I don't understand, imaging how painful it is being a cancer patient. There is absolutely going to be a great doubt and distrust in your heart in respect of this mail,coupled with the fact that so many individual have taken possession of internet to facilate their nefariouse deeds,thereby making it extremely difficult for genuine and legitimate business class persons to get attention and recognition.   I am Mrs. Alimatu Branco. I am Married to Mr. David Branco, who worked with our Embassy in Spain for nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $18.5 Million with a Bank in Benin Republic Presently this money is still in the custody of the Bank in Benin. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem, but I know that my doctor is not God. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a Church, Organisation or good person that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. I want a Church, Organisation or good person that will use this fund for Orphanages, Widows and other peoples that needs help and also propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that ""Blessed is the hand that giveth "" I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians not even good at all because they are the one that are responsible for the death of my husband in other to have all my late husband properties and  i don't want my husband's effort to be used by those that conspired for his death. This is why I am taking this decision, I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. Exodus 14   Vs 14  says  that  ""the Lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace"". I donï¿½t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives are around me always. I don't want them to know about this development and I know that with God all things are possible to those who trust in Him. As soon as I received your reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank in Benin. I will also issue a letter of authorization to the bank that will prove you the present beneficiary of this money. I also want you, Church or Organization to always pray for me because the Lord is my only Shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve Him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayer f ul l through your life. Contact me on this email address and any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another good person, church or organization for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.Hoping to receive your response immediately,Please reply with this email I.D wasiutunji22@yahoo.frThanks and Remain blessed in the Lord.I remain yours sister in Christ.

I am contacting you with the hope that you will b=e of great assistance to me, I currently have within my reach the sum of =24 million U.S dollars cash which I intend to use for investment purposes= outside Nigeria.=20This money came as a result of a payback contract deal between my husband= and a Russian firm in our country's multi-billion dollar Ajaokuta steel =plant. The Russian partners returned my husbands share being the above su=m after his death. Presently, the new civilian Government has intensified= their probe into my husbands financial resources which has led to the fr=eezing of all our accounts, local and foreign, the revoking of all our bu=siness licences and the arrest of my First son. In view of this I acted v=ery fast to withdraw this money from one of our finance houses before it =was closed down. I have deposited the money in a security company with th=e help of very loyal officials of my late husband. No record is known abo=ut this fund by the government because there is no  documentation showing= that we received such funds. The consignment was kept on an ""OPEN BENEFI=CIARY MANDATE"" with the Security Company to avoid detection, seizure or d=iversion.Due to the current situation in the country and government attitude to my= family, I cannot make use of this money within, thus I seek your help in= transferring this funds out of the sub-African region.

"This item from National Association of the Deaf   has been forwarded to you by Mrs Suha Arafat.<BR><BR>Dear Friend, I am Mrs.Suha Arafat Yasser from Palestinian. I am married to the late formal head of state of Palestinian for several years before he died in France after a brief illness. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only few days. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $18m (eighteen million U.S.Dollars)with a BANK in London. Presently, I have carefully moved this funds out of the bank in London and deposit it with a private company in Europe as a photo material for family use for safe keeping so that my govern we not know about this funds as they have already seized and freeze all the bank account belonging to my late husband both home and abroad. In fact the total sum allegedly discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of about $6.5 Billion Dollars. And they are not relenting on their effort to make me poor for life. As you know, the Moslem community has no regards for woman, hence my desire for a foreign assistance. You can visit the BBC news b roadcast below for better understanding of what I am talking about.http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3479937.stmhttp:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3995769.stmIt is on this note that I'm asking your partnership to keep this fund to your account. I took this decision because my government is not in good terms with me; I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of the presence of my government agents around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible.

"FYICQ TODAY ONLINE NEWS â APPROPRIATIONSJune 4 2009 â 1:39 p.m.War Supplemental Conference Slips to Next WeekBy Josh Rogin CQ StaffHouse leadership has decided not to hold a conference or a vote on the war supplemental spending bill thisweek as leaders worked behind the scenes to secure enough Democratic votes to pass the measure absent GOPsupport.Multiple lawmakers and aides confirmed the expected Thursday session to finalize negotiations over the bill(HR 2346) which is mainly to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will not occur until at least early nextweek. Democratic leaders were trying to convince as many as 18 of the 51 Democrats who voted against theHouse version in May to change their votes but many said they would not do so.Republicans are promising to vote against the conference report en mass if it includes $5 billion worth offunding related to the International Monetary Fund. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif. said Thursday itwould.""I believe there are people in the Republican Party who support [the IMF funding]; they just don't want tosupport it on this bill"" Pelosi said Thursday ""So we have to do that with all Democratic votes.""She also pushed back against two key pillars of the House Republican leadership's argument against the IMFfunding which is meant to accommodate an increased U.S. credit extension to the organization.Responding to statements of Minority Leader John A. Boehner of Ohio that the IMF money is unrelated to thewar spending measure Pelosi said the IMF help was a ""national security initiative"" because it helps to alleviatesources of instability such as poverty.Pelosi also accused House Minority Whip Eric Cantor R-Va. of fear mongering by putting out a statementwarning that IMF assistance could somehow fund terrorism.""I don't know why anyone would say that the money is going to the hands of terrorists"" she said. ""It simply isnot based in fact and is a scare tactic and most unfortunate.""House Democratic aides said the conference on the supplemental bill probably would be early next week.""We're going to come up with a supplemental conference report in the next few days"" said Senate Majorityleader Harry Reid D-Nev.6Whipping VotesHouse leaders had planned to hold the conference session Thursday and had said the House floor vote could beas early as Friday. But their effort to convince members to switch their no votes was still underway Thursdayafternoon. â¢Although several high ranking Democrats have pledged to switch their no votes including Reps. Barney FrankD-Mass. and George Miller D-Calif. many others have said they would not.""It's a conscience vote"" said Rep. Alan Grayson D-Fla. who said he was inclined to not change his stance onthe bill""I haven't cracked yet"" said Rep. Jim McGovern D-Mass. who along with other anti-war Democrats haspledged to be against any war funding that does not provide for the withdrawal of troops from southwest Asia.Still many Democrats said that the leadership was lobbying them relatively intensely.More Details EmergeMeanwhile more details of the near finalized supplemental conference report negotiations came out Thursday.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Daniel K. Inouye D-Hawaii said that the final bill will ""in alllikelihood"" include money for 5 C-130 transport planes and 8 C-17 cargo planes none of which was requestedby the administration or in the Senate's bill. The House bill had sought 11 C-130s and the 8 C-17s.Overall the defense portion of the bill is expected to be about $4 billion less than the House version but stillbillions above the Senate version and the administration request House Appropriations Defense subcommitteechairman John P. Murtha D-Pa. said.As for the fate of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay Cuba the conference report likely will include languagebarring the administration from transferring prisoners to U.S. soil for the remainder of the fiscal year saidHouse Appropriator James P. Moran D-Va.No money towards the president's effort to close the prisons will be in the conference report Moran added. Thepresident had requested $80 million but neither the House nor Senate versions included those funds.John M Donnelly and Katherine Hunter contributed to this storySource: CQ Today Online NewsRound-the-clock coverage of news from Capitol Hill.Â© 2009 Congressional Quarterly Inc.

Before his death we were married for 11 good years without achild and were both born again Christians . Since his death I decidednot to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible forbids.  When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $10.5 Million (Ten Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank.Presently, this money is still under the safe keeping of theRESERVE FINANCE COMPANY Recently, my Doctor told me that I would notlast for the next Three(3) months due to my cancer problems. Though what disturbs me most now, i recently had stroke.Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to church or betterstill a Christian or muslim individual That will utilize this money theway I am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use thisfund on, orphanages, deaf and dumb and poor widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision.

I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd,you will also promise me that you will not seat on the fund when it gets into your bank account. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always beprayerful all through your life, any delay in your reply will give me room in serching for a church or Christian individual for this same purpose.

In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his wife and two children in July 2000 in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased, as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him in the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

Ok.
FYI we are putting out the following statement.STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTONBombing of the Shrine of Syed Ali Hujviri in LahoreI was shocked and saddened by yesterday's attack on one of Pakistan's most popular places of worship the Shrine ofSyed All Hujviri (Data Ganjbakhsh) in Lahore which claimed the lives of many innocent Pakistanis.The extremists have shown that they respect neither human dignity nor the fundamental religious values of Pakistanisociety. Violating the sanctity of this revered shrine is a particularly sinister attempt to destabilize Pakistan and tointimidate its people. The attackers will not succeed as the Pakistani public refuses to be cowed by such violence.We condemn this brutal crime and reaffirm our commitment to support the Pakistani people in their efforts to defendtheir democracy from the violent extremists who seek to destroy it.

This is from Fr. Borys Gudziak the wonderful priest you met in Lviv. He gave you a tour of the Cathedral and you had awonderful chat with him at the time. Since then much progress has been made there. He became head of the newUkrainian Catholic University and has really come in to his own as a respected leader and scholar.Unfortunately his situation and that of the Catholic community and academic freedom has come under siege sinceYanokovich became president. I have a series of emails from the US Ukrainian community in addition to this emaildirectly from Gudziak They are alarmed about developments. I've been in touch with John Tefft and sent him everything.He is aware of recent events.I will make a folder of the correspondence for you since the community here and in Ukraine sees you as their champion.This is not a good turn of events.

"LADY MARYAM ABACHA ABACHA COURT GIDADO ROAD KANO - NIGERIA ATTENTION:C.E.O I am lady Maryam Abacha, wife of the late General Sani Abacha,ex-military Head of State of the Federal Republic of Nigeria who died on the 8th of June 1998 of heart problems.I contacted you because of my need to deal with person/persons who my family and I have had no previous personal relationship with. An adventist friend of the family introduced you to me. Since the death of my husband, my family had been subjected to all sorts of harrassment and intimidation with lots of negative reports emanating from the government and the press about my husband. The present Government has also ensured that our bank accounts are frozen and all assests siezed. It is in view of this that I seek your co-operation and assistance in the transfer of the sum of US$100Million only being the very last of my family fund in my possession and control. The Federal Government have seized all our properties and frozen all our accounts both local and international, but my only hope now is the available US$100Million cash, which I carefully packaged and deposited with a security finance company in Holland.My purpose of contacting you is for someone who will be able to pay the dumurrage charges incured in the security finance company and also after transfering the funds, will be able to invest the funds on my behalf till such a time when I will be free from my present predicament.Your benefit I can assure you will be very substantial. Please ensure to keep this proposal very secret and confidential for obvious reasons and send to us your private telephone and fax numbers for easy and confidential communication. We await your immediate response. Sincerely yours, LADY MARYAM ABACHA "

Dear Friend and Partner,I solicit your strictest confidence in this proposal. This is by virtue of it's nature as been utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to us through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce Foreign Trade Division. We are top government officials drawn from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing FMW&H, the Presidency and the Federal Ministry of Finance FMF making up the Contract Review Panel CRP set up by the present administration to review all contracts awarded by the past government.In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered grossly over-invoiced contracts which were awarded to foreign contractors. The contract have been duly executed and commissioned but leaving the contract commission US$12.4M Dollars floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN ready for payment.The funds resulted from connivance between our predecessors and the foreign contractors. The contractors have been duly paid their contractual entitlement US$81M Dollars but leaving the over-invoiced funds US$12.4M Dollars in CBN's escrow account. We are therefore seeking your assistance in the transfer of these funds out of this country by providing your company name and address to be registered as a subsidiary or afilliate of the real company that executed the contract so as to effect the ballance of the funds into your account as part of the executor.This is necessary as we cannot use the help of a local contractor here since the job was executed by a foreign company. Hence the need for your assistance.All logistics and modalities are in place to ensure the smooth conclusion of this transaction within the nest 10 to 14 working days of commencement after the receipt of your company name and address as stated above including your telephone/fax numbers for better communication.These informations will enable us make the application and lodge claim to the concerned ministry and agency in favour of your company. It is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria corresspondent bankers around the World is going to be made in your name.Finally, when the funds hits your account, I and my associates will come over to your country for the sharing purpose as outlined categorically clear below.(i) US$10M Dollars for us the 3 members of the Contract Review Panel (ii)US$2M Dollars for you for acting as the beneficiary of the funds. (iii)US$.4M Dollars as an abstract projections for re-imbursement to both parties for any incidental expenses that may be incured during the process of the transaction.If you are interested, please write or call my direct access line above.I await your response in this regard.Your's Faithfully,Babatunde Pedro.(Engineer/director of Project FMW&H)."

She said there are still a few details to be worked out Monday.She ""wouldn't put a full stop on it"" though things are looking very good. Tomorrow will be a down day and they'llreconvene Monday to bang out last details and (hopefully) announce.I'll be in touch with other people in the morning and give you there reports.Will also check in with DecIan!"
Lona---Could we be ready to do on or before 12/18? I'm reluctant to schedule for early Jan. Also if we did in Dec wouldcoincide w Copenhagen.

Mylate father was among the few black Zimbabwean richfarmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of theruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for hisalleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean oppositionparty. Before the death of my father, he took me to SouthAfrica to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars($12m) with a security and finance company, as if heknew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money wasdeposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid muchdumourage from the security firm.This money was earmarked for the purchase of newmachinery and chemicals for the farms and theestablishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.This land problem arose when President R. MUGABEintroduced a new land Act. which wholly affects theWhite rich farmers and some few blacks vehementlycondemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by thegovernment. This resulted to rampant killing and mobactions. I and my family who are currently staying in SouthAfrica as refugees or asylum seekers have decidedto enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of theTrunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futhertransfer of the money to a foreign country where wecan invest it. I am faced with the dilemma ofclaiming/investing this amount of money in SouthAfrica for fear of encountering the same experience infuture since both countries have the same politicalhistory. Moreover, the South African monetary policy/law doesnot allow such investment hence I am seeking foran asylum or refugee.I must let you know that this business is 100% riskfree and the nature of your business does notnecessary matter. So if you are willing to assist usclaim the ownership of this money,I and my family haveagreed to give you 20% of the total money, 40% will befor a joint business venture I will be doing with youand another 35% will be for me and my family which weshall also invest in your country and the remaining 5%will be mapped out for all expenses we may incureduring the transaction.Therefor, if you are willing and interested to renderthe needed assistance. Please funish me your private phone and Faxnumberfor easy and better communication.Remember that this is highly confidential and thesuccess of this business depends on how secret it is kept.Expecting your reply soonest.Best Regard.BONGO WALE"

A day where we canall love each other as human beings and toss away theweapons of war, and cast out our fears and hatredsfrom our hearts into the graves. We must mourn thegraves of the innocents all over the world, and givethe children of the world the hope of a peaceful,loving and beautiful world. A world full of love and without hatred or fear. Aworld where we can join hands together and accept oneanother, regardless of our skin color, ethnicdivisions, religion or nationality. If we don't uniteas a human race, then we have condemned the futuregeneration of children a dark and very grim future. Think of love, compassion and peace always...MY PRAYER  FOR  PEACE AND HARMONYMerciful God, You made all of the people of the worldin Your own image and placed before us the pathway ofsalvation through different Preachers who claimed tohave been Your Saints and Prophets. But, thecontradictions (made by us) in the interpretation ofYour teachings have resulted in creating divisions,faith based hatreds and bloodshed in the worldcommunity. Millions of innocent men, women andchildren have so far been brutally killed by themilitants of several religions who have beencommitting horrifying crimes against humanity andmillions more would not be butchered by them in thefuture, if You guide and help us find ways to reunitepeacefully.IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE COMPASSIONATE, THE MERCIFUL,look with compassion on the whole human family; takeaway the controversial teachings of arrogance,divisions and hatreds which have badly infected ourhearts; break down the walls that separate us; reuniteus in bonds of love; and work through our struggle andconfusion to accomplish Your purposes on earth; that,in Your good time, all nations and races could jointlyserve You in justice, peace and harmony.

Your fans are here by the hundreds and eagerly awaiting your speech on the 12th!As you know the US has been a strong supporter of a new women's agency at the UN that would provide for an UnderSecretary General for women's issues better coordination and effectiveness and-- consolidation of a group of smallerentities. In bilats today I learned that some G77 countries are wondering what's in it for them. They're not developingcountries and they're not the UK or US. Brazil may be second guessing the creation of the new agency yet this is anagency that will benefit women everywhere. I don't know if you'll have an opportunity to say to Brazil's leader that wehope the UN women's agency will continue to have their support. In fact Tom Shannon told me that they're reallyinterested in women's issues and wanted to sign a MOU with us. Sometimes there's a disconnect between NY perm repsand their capitals2nd I don't know if you're still going to Chile. If you talk to Bachelet about her future you can tell that so many govt repsat the UN would like to see her head up the new women's agency. It's not clear if she's even interested.Thx

"Jake probably passed this on to you but just in case I think it's definitely worth readingA few comments from one of my staff members who has long experience withthe Middle East follow.From Martin: The principle conclusion from a quick visit to Israel and Ramallah over the weekend is thatNetanyahu is in a strong position politically with an unusually stable ruling coalition. Nobody I spoke withbelieved that the government would have fallen if he had decided to extend the settlement freeze before itsexpiry as a gesture to U.S. peacemaking efforts. In their view he could have easily garnered the support of alarge majority of the people for whom the settlers are a marginal concern. And this would have given himleverage over his ministers to ensure their support or abstention in the cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted Likudvoters are to the left of their Knesset members when it comes to peacemaking (70 percent support the two-statesolution vs only 50 percent of the leadership).Lieberman not the Likud is Bibi's chief concern. He wants to keep him in the government for as long aspossible for fear that when he leaves he will garner the support of those on the right including from the Likudwho oppose peacemaking. For the time being Bibi uses the threat of an alternative coalition with Kadima tokeep Lieberman in the tent. But the clock is ticking. According to Tzipi Livni she can bring her party into thegovernment now and is willing to do so without any demand for ""rotation"" provided Bibi is serious aboutnegotiating peace. But as the elections grow closer more and more of her party members are turning againstthe idea of joining the government. They are strengthened in their views by recent internal polling which showsKadima with 32 seats (up from 28 now) Likud slightly down at 25 and Labor at only 5.Therefore if Bibi intends to make a deal with Abu Mazen he will need to do so sooner rather than later. Thelonger he waits the less leverage he has on Lieberman and the more likely Lieberman will break away tooppose him in the next elections.In this context Bibi's negotiating tactics become self-defeating. Believing that he is a great negotiator and thathe is operating in the Middle East bazaar he inflates his requirements well beyond anything reasonable in thebelief that this is the best way to secure the highest price. The process of bringing him down to a reasonableprice uses up a lot of energy uses up a lot of goodwill humiliates his Palestinian negotiating partner and raisesdoubts about his seriousness. In the end under great pressure from all quarters he will make the finalconcession but only after wasting a lot of time making everybody furious with him and thereby securing nocredit either with his supporters or negotiating partners. At heart he seems to lack a generosity of spirit. Thiscombines with his legendary fear of being seen as a ""freier"" (sucker) in front of his people to create a realproblem in the negotiations especially because he holds most of the cards.This is further complicated by his introduction of the notion of ""creative ideas."" Thinking out of the box as helikes to do will only further delay the negotiations because the box is already well-defined. To attempt tobroaden the parameters will generate mistrust of his intentions on the Palestinian side just when directnegotiations provide the opportunity to build trust.The reason for dwelling on Bibi's psychology rather than his politics is that the latter all point in the direction ofmaking a deal: the Israeli public is ready to get on with it; if Israel doesn't make a serious move it will furtherdelegitimize its standing internationally (something Bibi is deeply concerned about); Bibi needs PresidentObama in his corner to deal with the threat from Iran and to avoid punishment by the voters for mishandlingrelations with the U.S.; and if he doesn't make the deal with Abu Mazen now he will have helped to advancethe future he is most concerned about - a llamas takeover of the Palestinian leadership.Yuval Diskin was quite clear about this latter point. After praising the Palestinian security services to the sky(unusual for him) he told me that he had warned Bibi that at the moment they have a high motivation to preventterror because they believe they are building their state. If that proves to be an illusion the motivation willdisappear and then he cannot guarantee security in the West Bank. He considers it quite possible that if Bibidoesn't quickly demonstrate his seriousness to Abu Mazen he will resign because his honor has now beenseriously damaged. He told Bibi that he cannot predict who will lead the Palestinians if Abu Mazen resigns butthat Salam Fayyad will likely have to go too.What is to be done? I have no magic solution for what must be a deeply frustrating exercise for you. Andplease forgive me if what I recommend here is just repeating what you already know.1.Put your arm around Bibi: he still thinks we are out to bring him down. There is no substitute for workingwith him even though he makes it such a frustrating process. But the purpose of embracing him is to nudgehim forward not to buy into his exaggerated political fears or accept his inflated demands.2. Try to find a way to make him understand that his negotiating tactics are counterproductive to his ownpurposes. The Obama Administration has done a great deal lately to underscore its concern for Israel's securityfrom the vote at the IAEA to the sanctions on Iran to the letter that Obama was willing to sign that acceptedBibi's security requirements. That should buy you credibility with him.3. As his friend paint a realistic picture of the strategic consequences of his negotiating tactics particularly interms of what is likely to happen to the PA leadership if he worries only about his politics and not at all aboutAbu Mazen's politics.4. If all else fails avoid recriminations in favor of a ""clarifying moment."" The world will of course blameBibi. But you should avoid any kind of finger-pointing in favor of a repeated commitment to a negotiatedsolution and a willingness to engage with both sides in trying to make that happen when they're ready. TheIsraeli public and the American Jewish Community should know how far the President was prepared to go andthey should be allowed to draw their own conclusions. Bibi Abu Mazen and the Arab states need negotiationsand time is not on the side of any of them. They will come back to the table sooner rather than later as long aswe keep the door open.From my staffer:AMAnne-Marie SlaughterDirector of Policy PlanningU.S. Department of State(202) 647-2972"
"Dear Sir,I am writing this proposal hoping that you would be of assistance in this business of mutual benefit. My name is Daniel Osondu an auditor at one of the Banks in lagos-Nigeria. During our last audit exercise,some amount of money totalling $18.5Million was discovered and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Manfred Becker, a foreigner who died in a crash. The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted our curiosity. I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his confidential document with the Ministry that he executed the contract for and also with our Bank. A panel setup by the Federal Government on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be unquestionably claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively the fund should be donated for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail.It is because of the perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Thomas Danababa , that arrangement is being made for the fund to be declared UNCLAIMABLED and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition which will further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my colleagues and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad. I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that effect.All documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for investment purposes in your country. If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly reach me immediately via my confidential fax number +23417597019 furnishing me with your most confidential telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that I can forward to you the relevant details of the transaction. I expect your urgent response. Regards,Mr. Daniel Osonduconfidential e-mail<danilosondu002@excite.com> "

"Levin opposed the surge but voted for funding the troops.Pasted below is Levin's speech on troops in Afghanistan. We'll have a copy for you as well.Afghan speech belowFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASESeptember 11 2009 Contact: Senator Levin's OfficePhone: 202.224.6221Senate Floor Speech - Surge the Afghan ArmyRemarks as prepared for deliveryToday we mark a solemn anniversary. Eight years ago this morning our nation was attacked by terrorist extremistsmotivated by hatred and bent on destruction. It is always appropriate to remember the shock of that day the innocentlives lost and the efforts our nation has made since that day to ensure that Afghanistan the nation that hosted thoseterrorists cannot again become a safe haven for terrorists seeking to attack us. But today is an especially appropriateoccasion to take stock of those efforts and consider how best to continue them.I recently returned from a trip to Afghanistan where I was joined by my colleagues Senators Jack Reed and TedKaufman. The situation in Afghanistan is serious. Security has deteriorated. But if we take the right steps we can ensurethat Afghanistan does not revert to a Taliban-friendly government that could once again provide a safe haven for alQaeda to terrorize us and the world.The Obama administration's new strategy focusing on securing the Afghan population's safety and partnering with theAfghan security forces in that effort is an important start at reversing the situation in Afghanistan. The change instrategy has led our forces in the words of General McChrystal's Counterinsurgency Guidance to ""live eat and traintogether [with the Afghan security forces] plan and operate together depend on one another and hold each otheraccountable....and treat them as equal partners in success."" The Guidance goes on to say that the success of the Afghansecurity forces ""is our goal.""To achieve that goal we should increase and accelerate our efforts to support the Afghan security forces in their effortsto become self-sufficient in delivering security to their nation â before we consider whether to increase U.S. combatforces above the levels already planned for the next few months. These steps include increasing the size of the AfghanArmy and police much faster than presently planned; providing more trainers for the Afghan Army and police thanpresently planned; providing them more equipment than presently planned; and working to separate local Talibanfighters from their leaders and attract them to the side of the government as we did in Iraq.While the security situation in Afghanistan has worsened we still have important advantages there. The Afghan peoplehate the Taliban. Public opinion polls show support for the Taliban at about 5%. In addition the Afghan army is highlymotivated and its troops are proven fighters.Despite those advantages we face significant challenges. General McChrystal believes and I agree that we need toregain the initiative and create a momentum towards success. General McChrystal worries and rightly so about theperception that we have lost that initiative and the impact of that perception on the Afghan people their governmental Qaeda and the Taliban. By contrast if we can dispel that perception we have a chance to convince local and lower-level Taliban fighters to lay down their arms and rejoin Afghan society.I believe the most effective way to retake the initiative in Afghanistan is with a series of steps to ensure thatAfghanistan's army and police have the manpower equipment and support to secure their own nation.First we should increase troop levels for the Afghan army and police faster than currently planned. There areapproximately 90000 troops in the Afghan army now and that number is scheduled to go up to 134000 by October of2010. The Afghan police are scheduled to reach a level of 82000 by the same time. For a long time many of us haveurged the establishment of a goal of 240000 Afghan troops and 160000 Afghan police by 2013. The Afghan Minister ofDefense has strongly supported those numbers. It now appears that our government and the Afghan government areprepared to accept those goals. But the need for additional Afghan forces is urgent. I believe it both possible andessential to advance those goals by a year to 2012.Our own military in Afghanistan has repeatedly pointed to a need for more Afghan forces. In one sector of Helmandprovince we visited last week our Marines outnumbered Afghan soldiers by 5 to one. A Marine Company commander inHelmand province told the New York Times in July that a lack of Afghan troops ""is absolutely our Achilles heel.""What do we need to do to increase the size of the Afghan army and police? According to Afghan Defense MinisterWardak there is no lack of Afghan manpower; we've been assured it is available.But we will need significantly more trainers. We asked General Formica who is in charge of the American effort to trainAfghan security forces whether such an increase is possible. He indicated he would make an assessment of what wouldbe necessary in order to meet the earlier timetable. In the meantime we should also press our NATO allies with muchgreater forcefulness to provide more trainers. If our NATO allies are not going to come through with the combat forcesthey have pledged at least they could provide additional trainers.Larger Afghan security forces will also require more mid-level Afghan officers. In addition to supporting efforts tograduate more Afghan officers from army academies we should consider the recommendation of Defense MinisterWardak that previous mid-level officers who fought the war against the Soviets return to service on an interim basis.Minister Wardak emphasized that those men are well qualified and well motivated and while they may not be trained inthe most current tactics they nonetheless could temporarily meet the need of the enlarged army while the new groupof officers is trained. A larger Afghan force will need supporting infrastructure such a barracks. While the availableinfrastructure may not be the most modern it is adequate and exists in sufficient amounts.Larger Afghan security forces will require additional equipment. There must be a major effort to transfer a significantamount of the equipment that is coming out of Iraq to the Afghan army and police. Such a significant commitment toequip the Afghan security forces would also help demonstrate U.S. determination to take the initiative and createmomentum in the right direction. There is an enormous amount of equipment coming out of Iraq; our military is callingit one of the greatest transfers of military goods in the world's history. A significant part of it could be transferred to theAfghan forces increasing their capability without weakening our own readiness. And yet there does not seem to be thatkind of a crash effort in place to do that. We need to obtain on an urgent basis a list of the basic equipment needs of theAfghan forces and a list of how those needs could be met in a major program to transfer equipment leaving Iraq.Rapidly expanding Afghanistan's military and police forces would address one of the major problems and risks we nowface there. General McChrystal told us he worries that waiting until 2013 for a larger Afghan force creates a gap incapabilities that brings significant risk of failure. But by accelerating the training and equipping of Afghan forces by ayear we address his concern. Depending on additional capability from Afghan rather than U.S. forces also addresses amajor problem of public perception in Afghanistan. The larger our own military footprint there the more our enemiescan seek to drive a wedge between us and the Afghan population spreading the falsehood that we seek to dominate aMuslim nation.Finally we should make a concerted effort to separate the local Taliban from their leaders. In Iraq large numbers ofyoung Iraqis who had been attacking us switched over to our side and became the ""Sons of Iraq."" They were drawn inpart by the promise of jobs and amnesty for past attacks and in part by the recognition that the status quo was creatinghorrific violence in their own communities. In their own interests and the interests of their nation they switched sidesand became a positive force.That same prospect exists in Afghanistan. Afghan leaders and our military say that local Taliban fighters are motivatedlargely by the need for a job or loyalty to the local leader who pays them and not by ideology or religious zeal. Theybelieve an effort to attract these fighters to the government's side could succeed if they are offered security forthemselves and their families and if there is no penalty for previous activity against us.General McChrystal himself has emphasized the potential of such re-integration to accomplish the same result as wasachieved in Iraq. Here is what General McChrystal said on July 28th:""Most of the fighters we see in Afghanistan are Afghans some with foreign cadre with them. But most we don't see aredeeply ideological or even politically motivated; most are operating for pay; some are under a commander's charismaticleadership; some are frustrated with local leaders. So I believe there is significant potential to go after what I would callmid- and low-level Taliban fighters and leaders and offer them re-integration into Afghanistan under the constitution.""But this ""game changing"" possibility was apparently not factored into General McChrystal's assessment. There is no planyet to put in place a Sons of Iraq approach in Afghanistan. It is urgent that we lay out the steps that need to be taken toinvolve local and national Afghan leaders in that effort. They alone can accomplish this crucial job but first we and ourAfghan allies must draft such a plan on an urgent basis. And the potential positive impact of such a plan should be takeninto account as we consider the need for any additional U.S. military resources.Afghanistan's people are grateful for our aid but also eager to assume responsibility for their future. In a tiny village inHelmand Province we were invited to meet with the village elders at their council meeting their shura. One hundred orso men sat on the floor and chatted with us about their future and their country's future. When asked how long theUnited States should stay one elder said: ""Until the moment that you make our security forces self-sufficient. Then youwill be welcome to visit us not as soldiers but as guests.""Helping Afghanistan achieve self-sufficiency in their security is everybody's goal. On that there is little difference ofopinion in Afghanistan's village councils or in the corridors of this Capitol.Can we help Afghanistan reach self-sufficiency in security fast enough? Can we get there in a way that regains theinitiative and creates the momentum we need? Can we encourage those lower level Taliban to abandon an insurgencyheaded by terrorists whose fanaticism they don't share?I believe we can by supporting a far more rapid growth in the Afghan Army and police; by providing more trainers morequickly; by a rapid infusion to Afghan units of equipment no longer needed in Iraq; and by rapidly adopting a plan for there-integration of lower level Taliban fighters into Afghan society. In other words we need a surge of Afghan securityforces.Our support of their surge will show our commitment to the success of a mission that is clearly in our national securityinterest without creating a bigger U.S. military footprint that provides propaganda fodder for the Taliban.I believe that taking those steps on an urgent basis while completing the previously planned and announced increase inU.S. combat forces provides the best chance of success for our mission: preventing Afghanistan from again being run bya Taliban government which harbors and supports Al-Qaeda whose goal is to inflict additional catastrophic attacks onthe United States and the world. And we should implement these steps before considering an increase in U.S. groundcombat forces beyond what is already planned by the end of this year."

">From Gordon and Rosepl0t 5 site G,v/island ikoyi,lagosNigeria.Email=gord_wiliams1@yahoo.co.ukGood a thing to write you,which however is not mandatory nor will in any manner compel you to honour against your will. Dearest we are Gordon and Rose Wiliams ,of our late Parents Mr and mrs Victor Williams.

But God knows the truth!Our mother died when we where small ,and since then our Father took us so special. Before His death, My father called me and told  me that he has the sum of (USD$12.500,000) ( MILLION UNITED STATES  DOLLARS )deposited with an international bank in Republic Nigeria  west Africa. He further told me that He deposited the money with the name  of a business partner while I am the next of kin to the deposited money. >From Gordon and RoseWe are just young 16 and 18 years old and a high school college people, with  little knowledge of business that is why We are in need of a partner whom  will assist us to get this fund released for investments in his or her country while I proceed with our education, Dear,We are in a sincere desire of your humble assistance on this regard, and your suggestions and ideas will be highly appreciated.Now permit me to ask these few questions? 1.

"Goodday,I am Joseph vaye,the son of late Issac Nuhan Vaye, deputy minister of publicworks under President charles taylor of Liberia.Before the political upheaval in liberia my late father was a good andclose friend of presidentcharles taylor and a member of his inner caucus.But of late when liberiacrisis came up again,with the rebels trying to oust charles taylor outof government and liberia,president charles taylor became very uncomfortablewith some of his loyalists which my late father happened to be one of thembecause he had the believe that at the rate at which the rebel group was closing in on him in Monrovia(which is the seat of power)was as a resultof the leakage of some vital security information  from his cabinet and hedecided to eliminate some of his cabinet members which my father happenedto be a victim.It started in the name of an uncovered coup and he ordered the arrest ofsome of his cabinet ministersand the Vice President Moses Blah on the 5th of june which my father wasincluded and some days later we learnt about my father's death alongsidewith John Winpoe Yormie, deputy minister of national security.My mother and i actually knew why my father was murdered because beforethe political mayhem inliberia,my late father  and President charles taylor have maintained agood relationship and he hasassisted him in lodging funds from the sales of diamond in different banksand security companies which my late father also benefited from it untilat the wake of rebellious war in liberia my father was not getting along withPresident Charles taylor because of his tyranic law which created a breachin their relationship and with the alarming rate at which the rebels areadvancing into Monrovia to unseat President charles taylor he was no longersure of  some of his cabinet members and decided to eliminatethem under the disguise that they were coup plottersBefore the death of my father, at the peak of his relationship with president charles taylor,he was ableto accumulate some funds $31,600,000.00 (US$31.6million)which he depositedwith a security company in Ghana from the deals he did for the president.Basically my mother and i require a trustworthy person that can assistus to retrieve our funds from thesecurity company in Ghana.Life has been very unstable for us(my mum,myyoungers ones and i) and i would not want to bore you with all we wentthrough but for the sake of my late fathers death. All the necessary documents for the deposit are in my possession I am now a refugee in neigbouring african country Ghana due to the fear of been killed by president charles taylor and the unrest in Liberia.Ironically the president of Nigeria  has agreed to grant  president charlestaylor assylum in Nigeria inorder to restore peace in liberia so we are trying to do all  we can atearnest to retrieve the funds fromthe security company and leave West Africa before he eventually comes toNigeria.Upon your response to this mail,i will intimate you on how we can proceedto get the funds from the security company.Best regards,Joseph"

"Mr. Jun Cheng,Bank Of Korea,16-1, Yoido-dong, Youngdungpo-gu, Seoul 150-873.Dear Friend         I am Jun Cheng a manager of bills/exchange at the  foreign remittance  department of Hanivitbank. In my department, we  discovered an  abandoned sum of  $44,700,000.00 (Forty Four Million, Seven Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only) in an account that  belonged to one Late Mr Andrew Phillips an American, who died along with his entire  family, on November  1996, in a ghastly plane crash. Since we got the  information about his death,  we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and file a claim as next of kin over his money because we can not release it unless somebody applied for it as next of  kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our  banking guidelines.          Unfortunately, nobody has come forward to claim this  money.  It is based on this that some officials in my department and I have decided to establish a cordial business relationship  with you, hence by contacting you. We want you to present yourself as the  next of kin  to Late Mr Andrew Phillips, so that the funds can be remitted into your account. Moreover, we do not want the money to go into the government account as unclaimed bills. The banking law and guidelines here  stipulates that  any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of years, is deemed closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the government treasury account.            Now, it is being speculated that the above sum will be transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund on or before the end of this financial quarter of 2004, when nobody come forward to lay claims. The reason for requesting your assistance, is occasioned by, the fact that the deceased (Late Mr Andrew Phillips) was a foreigner, and we have access to his detailed bio data which you will hold as a weapon to present yourself as the next of kin to Late Mr Andrew Phillips.          The mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your account, shall be 70% to my colleagues and I, for the role you will be expected to play in this deal, we have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum and 5% for the expenses we are going to encounter by the two parties in the course of this transaction. Therefore,you are expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to participate in this business. After receiving your reply, you will be communicated to with the exact steps to take. I expect your urgent response and I shall contact you for further discussion on this matter,to enable us conclude this transaction urgently without any delay or hitch. Please treat this business proposal as strictly confidential for security reasons considering my official position in Bank of Korea.Personal Regards,Mr. Jun Cheng___________________________________________________________________________Mail sent to Webmaster.- http://www.1stpd.net"

"Dear Friend, SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in soinformal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgentneed to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreignpartner. This request may seem strange andunsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and praythat you view it seriously. My name is MR WILLIAMS DANIEL of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of theclose aides to the former President of the DemocraticRepublic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessedmemory, may his soul rest in peace. Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA toforce out the rebels in my country, I and some of mycolleagues were instructed by Late President Kabilato  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth ofTwenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United StatesDollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebelgroup. But when President Kabila was killed in abloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before wewere schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately decided to divert the fund into a private securitycompany here in Congo for safe keeping. The securityof the said amount is presently being threatened herefollowing the arrest and seizure of properties of Col.Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila)a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel fromour same tribe, by the new President of the DemocraticRepublic of Congo, the son of late President LaurentKabila, Joseph Kabila. In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthyforeign partner who can assist us to move this moneyout of my country as the beneficiary.WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund underDiplomatic Cover to a security company in the europein your name. This is to ensure that the DiplomaticBaggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will notpass through normal custom/airport screening andclearance.Our inability to move this money out of Congo allThis while lies on our lack of trust on our supposedgood friends (western countries) who suddenly becamehostile to those of us who worked with the latePresident Kabila, immediately after his son tookoffice. Though we have neither seen nor met eachother, the information We gathered from an associatewho has worked in your country has encouraged andconvinced us that with your sincere assistance, thistransaction will be properly handled with modestyand honesty to a huge success within two weeks. Thesaid money is a state fund and therefore requires atotal confidentiality.Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fundout of Congo, you can contact me through my emailaddress above with your telephone, fax number andpersonal information to enable us discuss themodalities and what will be your share(percentage) for assisting us.I must use this opportunity and medium to implore Youto exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this Matterextraordinarily confidential, Whatever your Decision,while I await your prompt response.

I am Director of Procurement Department at the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, here in the United Arab Emirates.  I obtained your email while searching for a reliable person, who could assist me in receiving transfer of a supposed contract awarded funds.  This fund came as a result of over estimated contract awarded sums executed by foreign contractors in the Petroleum Ministry. This fund has been approved for payment to the contractor by the concerned Ministry. The contracts had been executed and commissioned. What I am about to receive now, is the over estimated funds which the contractor whom I helped during the process of obtaining the contracts added to his estimation for my own interest.  This is a normal deal that goes in my Ministry by top officials. On our part, all modalities has been worked out in ensuring a smooth conclusion of the transfer to your account within the next few days.  All I want from you is to receive this funds on my behalf, because as Government Official I cannot collect the funds directly from the contractor, neither I am allowed by Law to operate/ run foreign bank accounts. If you are trustworthy and can assist me in receiving the fund, do not hesitate to respond back to me immediately.Please note that there is no risk involved in receiving the funds in your account for and it will be done through wire transfer. I wish you to state in percentage what you shall have for the use of your account.  As soon as you indicate your interest, further details and the amount involved shall be given to you once I hear from you.  Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. Looking forward to hearing from you soonest.Best regards,Engr. Abbah Nasser.Ministry of Petroleum and Ministry Resources.United Arab Emirates."

Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in NNPC by my Committee. This contract was over invoiced to the tune of US$21.5M. U.S. Dollars. This was done deliberately. The over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project. We now want to transfer this money which is in a suspense Account with NNPC into any Overseas Account which we expect you to provide for us. "

"Dear sir,I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates or landed properties in your country on behalf of the Director of Contracts and Finance Allocation of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in Nigeria.Considering his very strategic and influential position, he would want the transaction to be strictly as confidential as possible. He further wants his identity to remain undisclosed at least for now, until the completion of the transaction. Hence our desire to have an oversea agent.I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as our overseas agent in order to actualise this transaction.The deal in brief, is that the funds with which to carry out our proposed investments in your country is presently in a coded account in the Nigerian apex bank and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to your country or any safe account outside your country in a convenient bank account that will be provided by you before we can put the funds into use.For this you shall be considered to have executed a contract for the ministry. The contract sum of which shall run into US$15.5Million of which your share shall be 30% if you agree to be our overseas agent.Your area of specialisation does not matter in this transaction,all that is required of you is a safe account and your willingness to assist us acquire estates in your country.As soon as payment is effected and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into youraccount, we intend to use our own share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too, you shall serve as our agent . I will be with you before the remmittance is made into your provided account to allow trust to play a very minimal role until performance is seen.You are requested to communicate your acceptance or otherwise of this proposal to me,After which we shall discuss in details the modalities for seeing this transaction through.If however, you are not disposed to assist, kindlydelete/detroy this letter in view of the confidentiality of the proposed transaction and interest of personalities involved.Thank you in anticipation of your co-operation.Yours sincerely,KAYODE PHILLIP."

"Dear FriendThis letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a =day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. I am Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, currently Head of Corporate affairs with a =reputable bank here in Dubai -U. A. E. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to =reveal to you.I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On =November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) =for 36 calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my =bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003, as his account =officer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address =but the letter was returned undelivered. After sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was again returned =and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand =of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. =On further investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser=92s family wife and =two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, =including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any WILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under =dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard from the owner since 2003. I wish to let you know that all the =investigation I have made so far, my bank management is not aware of it, I am the only one that have the information.With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to =support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By end of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law =which will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not =for terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the =money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source of the money. I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and =that is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer to =late Al Nasser, coupled with my present position and status in the bank as =Head of Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, =with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. =All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and =there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under =a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside =U. A. E is porous and anything goes.If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share =the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over =the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality.

Can we find out more?
"-- Good evening,My name is Mr. Solomon Kaku, a banker here in Ghana. I write you this proposal in good faith as a brother, believing that you will not betray me regarding the information I am about to reveal to you. In 2002 a Crude Oil dealer Late Mr. MICHAEL SCHMIDT, made a (Fixed deposit) for 60 calendar months, valued at US$14,600,000.00 (Fourteen Million, Six hundred Thousand US Dollars) with my bank. I was his account officer before I rose to the position of manager. The maturity date for this deposit contract was 20th of August 2005. I have tried my possible best to locate Mr. Michael to notify him about this, but all my efforts proved abortive. I later discovered that Mr. Michael, his wife and only daughter were among the victims of bomb blast during the war in Iraq. Unfortunately, he has no other living relatives to inherit this fund.Now, a new Financial Law, which takes effect in two monthï¿½s time, stipulates that any bank account more than $5,000,000.00 [Five Million US Dollars] will be investigated and the bank shall produce the account owner for clearance. This is a Government measure to check money laundering. If I do not find a way to move this money out of the country immediately, in two monthï¿½s time, it might be reverted to Government treasury because the bank management cannot provide Mr. Michael since he is now late. I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the account since you are a foreigner, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you. It is only a foreigner can claim the funds in the account.  There is no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. Let me know how much percent you will take, so that both parties will be satisfied. Contact me as soon as you receive this message for further details. Please, treat as top secret, I am the only person having this information. Regards,Solomon Kaku."

This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under dormant/ =unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard from the =owner since 2003.

With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to =support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By =end of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which =will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above =$5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not for =terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country =immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the =money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source =of the money.  I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner =and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance.

"pverveeSecretary Clinton âI understand you are going to Kenya next week and while I know the trip is primarily focused on trade issues Iwanted to flag an issue for you because I know it is near and dear to your heart.Kenya has one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in Africa â it is illegal unless a woman's life is at risk andcriminalizes both the woman and the provider. Two years ago Kenyan authorities imprisoned a doctor andtwo nurses falsely accusing them of providing illegal abortions. After a year in prison the providers werefound innocent and released but it galvanized the legal and provider community who formed a coalition tomake abortion less restrictive. It will come as no surprise to you that as a result of their abortion law Kenyahas one of the highest maternal mortality rates in all of Africa with an estimated 800 women a day seekingthe procedure often through dangerous means.Kenya is restarting a long-stalled constitutional review process and they hope to produce a final Constitutionby next year. Religious groups are on a concerted crusade to include new language in the Constitution whichwould codify that ""life begins at conception"". The current Constitution is largely silent on the issue. If this fetalpersonhood amendment goes forward it would place Kenya in the small community of nations with such aprovision. It would clearly mark Kenya as out of stop with countries attempting to institutionalize the AfricanUnion's Maputo Protocol one of the most progressive regional documents on women development andreproductive rights and with the vast majority of African countries in general. For a country trying to regainthe momentum of stability and success it enjoyed until recently such a policy imposition would be aregression for women's rights and for the country writ large.I went to Kenya last month to work with the coalition that has formed to strategize against the Constitutionalamendment and to work toward a less restrictive abortion law. I also visited several of our clinics andproviders in Nairobi and in nearby villages where Planned Parenthood has programs to train providers in postabortion care. You have seen this a million times in your travels around the world so I don't need to tell youhow poignant the stories were of the lives saved and lost the bravery in standing up to constant governmentharassment and the fear of what this potential Constitutional amendment will mean to the provision of safemedical services. I know it is asking a lot but if there is any way that you could draw attention to this issuewhen you are in Kenya you would be even more of my personal hero than you already are. It is our hope thatif Kenya knows the world is watching they may be more careful in how they proceed. Of course we would behappy to help you in any way if you decide you want to do something on this while you are there. There is alsoa Congressional delegation going to Kenya the week of August 8th and we are working on them to have a sidemeeting on this issue as well.As always thank you so much for all you do. We are all so grateful that you are there! All best LaurieLaurie RubinerVice President of Public Policy and AdvocacyPlanned Parenthood Federation of America(202) 973-4863 office"

"sbwhoeopThursday August 26 2010 9:05 AMIn case you missed and see last graph. SidH: In Case you missed this by the FT international affairs editor esp the last graph. SidFinancial Times FT.cornA poisoned process holds little hopeBy David GardnerPublished: August 25 2010 22:46 1 Last updated: August 25 2010 22:46âAs the caravans of Middle East peace negotiators rumble into Washington next week for the umpteenth time thepervasive cynicism and sense of deja vu all over again is overwhelming â and with good reason.The Middle East peace process long ago turned into a tortured charade of pure process while events on the ground â inparticular the relentless and strategic Israeli colonisation of occupied Palestinian land â pull in the opposite direction topeace. ""We have all been colluding in a gigantic confidence trick"" is how one Arab minister puts it ""and here we goagain.""While many factors had combined to hand veto powers to rejectionists on both sides the heart of the question remainsthe continuing Israeli occupation. It is essential to remember that the biggest single increase of Jewish settlers on Araband â a 50 per cent rise â took place in 1992-96 under the governments of peace-makers Yitzhak Rabin and ShimonPeres at.the high-water mark of the Oslo peace accords. Many Israelis will point to the perfidy of the late Yassir Arafatwho wanted to talk peace but keep the option of armed resistance dangerously in play. But what killed Oslo was theoccupation. The second intifada that erupted a decade ago was essentially the Oslo war.A decade on the Israeli settlement enterprise has turned the occupied West Bank into a discontiguous scattering ofcantons walled in by a security barrier built on yet more annexed Arab land and criss-crossed by segregated Israeli roadslinking the settlements. Last month B'Tselem the Israeli human rights group published a study showing Israel has nowtaken 42 per cent of the West Bank with 300000 settlers there and another 200000 in East Jerusalem. The siege ofGaza has turned that sliver of land into a vast open-air prison.The main feature of the present situationi is the disconnect between the high politics of the utterly discredited peaceprocess and these â in Israeli parlance â ""facts on the ground"".At last month's White House summit where Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu massaged their long estrangementinto a political armistice the US president praised the Israeli prime minister as a leader ""willing to take risks for peace"".But there is no evidence for this whatsoever. True in June last year in response to Mr Obama's Cairo speech denyingany legitimacy to Israel's settlements Mr Netanyahu forced himself to utter the words ""Palestinian state"" â but hesurrounded them with barbed-wire caveats that voided them of meaning.Indeed the words all sides use â peace resolution security and so on â may be the same; but what each side means bythem is different.The mainstream Palestinian leaders President Mahmoud Abbas and Salem Fayyad the prime minister and the Quartetmade up of the US the European Union the UN and Russia talk of a negotiated resolution. This means two states livingin peace and security and a Palestinian homeland on the 22 per cent of Mandate Palestine taken by Israel in the 1967Arab-Israeli war. East Jerusalem would serve as the capital of the West Bank and Gaza with marginal land swaps topreserve some Israeli settlements near Jerusalem. But what does Mr Netanyahu mean?He has been most clear on what he does not mean. For a start he has set his face against any concessions onJerusalem. He wants to keep most settlements except for the far-flung ""ideological"" ones and the 100-plus ""outposts""established as pawns to be traded once the chess game began. His idea of a demilitarised Palestinian state is more like asort of supra-municipal administration than a self-determined independent government.Will he surprise us on the hackneyed Nixon and China principle that holds it is politicians of the right who most easilyclose difficult deals? There is little to suggest that:The thinking of Mr Netanyahu son of a celebrated promoter of Greater Israel has always been profoundly irredentist.While his nationalist Likud faces the constraints of being in coalition with an assortment of ultra-rightist and ultra-orthodoxparties as well as Labour that was plainly his choice; the centrist Kadima party was (and remains) an alternative. To befair Israel's electoral system â with a low threshold for entry into the Knesset that makes multi-party coalitions inevitable âmeans lobbies such as the settlers can take the national interest hostage. But Mr Netanyahu magnifies this by his choiceof partners and by diligently firing up the ultra-hawks in the pro-Israel lobby in the US.As risks he. has taken for peace Exhibit A is the much-hyped moratorium on settlement-building which expires nextmonth and has in any case been speciously interpreted. While the bulldozers to build settlements have been idlingmoreover the bulldozers demolishing Palestinian homes have been roaring: the rate of demolition in and aroundJerusalem has doubled this year while the army has just razed the village of al-Farisiye in the Jordan Valley in line withMr Netanyahu's strategically obsolete obsession with keeping the valley as Israel's eastern border.As diplomacy struggles to keep alive the viability of a two-state solution three rival systems of control have crystallised inthe occupied territories that would make up a future Palestinian homeland: the settlements; the crimped PalestinianAuthority of Mr Abbas and Mr Fayyad; and then Hamas which Israel and its Arab and western allies have tried and failedto marginalise. Time is short for a negotiated outcome; it may even have run out.The outlines of a deal are clear in the (Bill) Clinton parameters of 2000 and Arab Peace initiative of 2002 endorsed by 22Arab and 57 Muslim countries (as well as Hamas as part of the 2007 Mecca accord). There has to be an end to theoccupation and the US and Quartet cannot just allude to this; they must demand it.The writer is international affairs editor""FT"" and ""Financial Times"" are trademarks of the Financial Times.

Those planning to vote in thespecial election only report having voted for Barack Obama in 2008 by a 16 pointmargin in contrast to his actual 26 point victory in the state.That decline in turnout from Obama voters plagued Democratic candidates for Governorin Virginia and New Jersey last fall. Beyond that 66% of Republicans say they're 'veryexcited' about turning out while only 48% of Democrats express that sentiment.Brown leads 63-31 with independents and is winning 17% of the Democratic vote whileCoakley receives only 6% support from GOP voters. Both candidates are relativelypopular with 57% viewing Brown favorably to only 25% unfavorable and 50% with apositive opinion of Coakley to 42% negative.Those folks planning to vote in the special election are actually opposed to Obama'shealth care plan by a 47/41 margin and only narrowly express approval of the President'soverall job performance 44/43.""The Massachusetts Senate race is shaping up as a potential disaster for Democrats"" saidDean Debnam President of Public Policy Polling.

"Since we got information about his death,we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane  crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery  that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety  and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want  this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision of a foriegn account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable  the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply first  to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of application that i will send to you,so i will like you to send to me your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text  of the application.I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction  is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all  required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

"Dear sir/madam      REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP  First, I must solicit your strict confidence in this transaction.This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential. Weare top officials of the Republic of Namibia Contract Review Panelwho are interested in importation of goods into our country withfunds amounting to US$35,500, 000.00(Thirty five Million five hundredThousand United States Dollars) which are presently held in suspensewith the regulatory Bank of my country.   Our duties include evaluation, vetting approvals for payment for theconstruction of Silicon mines and smelter complex in my country byforeign firms. By virtue of our position in Government, these contractswere with intent over invoiced to the tune of US$35,500, 000.00(Thirtyfive Million five hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to enable mycommittee benefit from the projects.  This over invoiced amount hasbeen tied to a particular aspect of the contract that has beensatisfactorily executed and inspected as the firms are presentlysecuring payment from my Ministry, where our Board is in charge of allforeign contract payment approval and recommendation to the payingbank.   As a civil servant still in active government service, we areforbiddenby law to operate an account outside the shores of Namibia. Hence thismessage to you seeking your assistance so as to enable me present youas a beneficiary of contractual claims alongside that of the othercontractors, to enable us transfer the difference of US$35,500, 000.00(Thirty Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) intoan account that will be nominated by you.On actualization, the fund will be disbursed as stated below:1.  20% to be allocated to you2.  80% due us.    All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for asmoothactualization of the transaction within the next few working days ofcommencement. For further details as to the workability of this"
Here is the latest (as of Saturday at 12:30 am). This reflects the changes we discussed in our call on Wednesday as wellas feedback from assorted vetters. I've also trimmed and tweezed it down to about6100 words. We should probably attempt to trim some more if we can.It's a very long piece. -- Lissa
"(1) Computer optimization and Installation 4,000.000.00.(2) Installation of 250,000.00 Monax Turbine$6,000.000.00(3) Turn around Maintenance $3,000,000.00The money will be shared as follows after transfer, 30% for you 70%  for me.I know exactly how to present you / your company as the Beneficiary of the funds.Yours Faithfully,Mr.Azzam Mahmud."
To follow up - the team tried its hand at a boiled down version of the CFR speech but in 700 words it lost the nuanceand amounted to a series of generalisms. We felt that a more specific topic would allow for a sharper message. Weselected democracy because it allows you to talk about a broad and relevant trend that cuts across global affairs; toreprise signature themes like Internet freedom civil society and the democracy/development nexus; and to underscorethat this administration takes these issues seriously. This was also an element of your CFR speech and provides somecontinuity in that respect as well. We were not looking to break new ground but rather to reinforce.

This money in question is part of the budget made by our President Mr. Joseph Kabila, in the fear that members of the United Nations (UN) could perhaps be mandated to offer their respective supports in forcing Iraq to disarm themselves. Eventually, his dreams do not match up with realities and as a result he (the President) started using the money on personal ground because nobody could question/probe his actions, as he believed.As his closest personal assistant and with the help of two other officials one of whom was the then deputy Director, Safety and Security Department, we were able to escape with two boxes containing the aforementioned sum. At present the boxes were deposited in a reputable Security firm here in South Africa and were registered as family belongings. We had agreed on the need for a foreign assistance with a legitimate bank account abroad, that will stand as, the beneficiary and partner as well in order to avoid suspicion, since we are existing as refugees here. Copies of certificate of Deposit as well as all necessary documents from the Security cc. are available for a hitch-free transaction.In addition, you are also required to come/send a representative (as far as you trust the person representing) to the Republic of South Africa for the purpose of the transfer, but only if, by one reason or the other you cannot embark on a Five working (5) days trip by yourself, according to the expert from within the bank. As things are now we had not really agreed on the actual amount that should be your remuneration for your kind assistance, which to us is no big deal. The crux of this subject in particular is the declaration of your interest after-which we enter into negotiations with you over the (percentage) issue. Other details of which you may want to know shall be discussed in due course.Please be kind enough to acknowledge this proposal by responding through the above E-mail address for a high level of confidentiality in this business deal.Best regards,Hon. Mr. hope sitholetel _27832378499			---------------------------------Do you Yahoo!? Check out the new Yahoo! Front Page. www.yahoo.com"

" bwean farmers a 45-day quit notice to leave their lands to the government. </DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>My family and I are caught up in this web of land politics, which also led to the death of our father. We have seen reforms after reforms by the government of Mugabe and we are fed up with it. Our economy is in shambles and it is just not profitable and safe enough for us to remain in Zimbabwe. We have decided to relocate our farm to Swaziland, a neighbouring country, where we have acquired lands. Our capital base is in South Africa where we are temporarily living pending such time logistics would be ready for full-scale operation in Swaziland. Bearing in mind that Mr. Thabo Mbeki (South African president) and his government are playing Russian roulette over the Zimbabwean land crisis, every effort has begun in earnest to move our capital base to a stable country where it can be safer. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>With a capital base of US$25.5Million, there is a great deal of secrecy involved to avoid the piercing eyes and smelling noses of both the governments of Zimbabwe and South !

"Dear Sir or Madam:We are keenly interested in setting up a new factory to produce 120,000 ERW oil casings per year to meet the big market of Shengli Oilfied. Since we lack some starting-up capital, we are seeking for investments. I will give you a brief introduction to the project as follow:I. Background:Shengli Oilfield, the second largest oilfield in China and the leading company of Sinopec Corp. (http://www.sinopec.com), as well as neighboring oilfields as Dagang Oilfield, Central Plain Oilfield and Jiangsu Oilfield are potential market of ERW oil casing. It is expected that the total oil casing needed in the above area is about 400,000 tons, including 260,000 tons in Sinopec and 150,000 tons in Shengli Oilfield. To meet the great need, we plan to set up a joint venture to produce 120,000 tons of ERW casings per year in Shengli Oilfield.  With good management and market outlets, we believe that this JV also has the potential to expand beyond China to other nations. II.

Its products have entering many areas as Shengli Oilfield, Daqing Oilfield, Liaohe Oilfield, Dagang Oilfield and so on. In 2002, the sale income amounted to over 600 million yuan.The Factory holds Quality accreditations as ISO9001, API and so on.III. Content of the projectIt is planned to introduce Japanese technology and equipment to set up one production line with range of casing diameter fromï¿½ï¿½114 to ï¿½ï¿½339.7 and produce 120,000 tons of ERW casings and delivery pipes per year.IV. Product specificationsFor Casing: grade of steel are J55 and N80, specification ranges from ï¿½ï¿½114 to ï¿½ï¿½339.7For delivery: grade of steel are X52ï¿½ï¿½X60ï¿½ï¿½X70, specification ranges from ï¿½ï¿½114 to ï¿½ï¿½339.7.V. Economic AnalysisThe total investment in this project is 142.41 million yuan. After the completion of the project, it is estimated that the internal financial rate of return before paying tax is 24.9 percent with a payback period of 5.6 years, and the internal rate of return after paying tax is 21.8 percent with a payback period of 5.9 years.The break-even point of the project is 46.95 percent, which means the project can keep balance if the annual output amount to 42,000 tons.VI. Plans for cooperationWe have set up a joint venture with Japan's Marubeni in the early of the year, with a registered capital of 57 million yuan. The capital structure is as follow:a. Shengli Oilfield Bureau of Administration          19.95 million yuan   35ï¿½ï¿½b. Shengli Oilfield Engineering Machinery Facotry     17.10 million yuan   30ï¿½ï¿½c. Dongying District State Assets Operation & Management Co., Ltd 5.70million yuan 10ï¿½ï¿½d. Marubeni Engineering Technology Co., Ltd           14.25 million yuan   25ï¿½ï¿½To meet our capital need for this project, we are now planned to increase our registered capital to 118.88 million yuan. Taking our added investment into consideration, we need another 34.68 million yuan to get the plan executed. So we are seeking a new joint venture partner who'd like to join this project and meet our capital requirement.We would like to exchange the information with the manufacturers and suppliers who are interested in this project and have discussion on raw material supply as well as jointly investing the factory establishment. And we hope we could have good cooperation in future.For additional information regarding this project, please feel free to contact us.Looking forward to your prompt reply.Sincerely yours, Tony LeungProject officer"

"Foreign Exchange DepartmentFirst National Bank South Africa.DR. Taofeek Marvin.taofeekmarvin@netscape.net  Dear Friend,I,DR Taofeek Marvin, the Director of Bills  & Exchange of the foreignRemittance Department at  FIRST NATIONAL  BANK SOUTH AFRICA. I got your address while searching for trustworthy individuals in various countries. In my department, we discovered an abandoned sum of $25, 5 million US Dollars in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died with his family in the September 11th plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come to our bank and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as a next of kin or relative to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed relatives died in the same plane crash leaving no relative behind to claim the fund. It is upon this discovery that l and other officials in my department decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relative to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we do not want this money to go into our bank treasury as an unclaimed fund. The banking law and guidelines here stipulate that if such money remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed funds. The request for a foreigner as a relative for this claim is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a South African cannot claim this fund as next of kin.We agreed that 20% of this money will go to the foreign partner who will supply the foreign account, 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the transaction and 75% will be for me and my colleagues. Thereafter and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement of the percentages as indicated above.If you are interested to assist in this transaction, kindly contact the writer on the above mobile number or private e-mail address. Please this transaction is risk free and you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for transfer.Yours Faithfully,DR  Taofeek MarvinBill & Exchange Director"

"http://www.bloomberq.comews/2010-07-14/americans-disappoving-of-obama-policies-poised-to-enable-republican-dains.htmlAmericans Disapproving Obama Poised to EnableRepublican GainsBy John McCormick and Catherine Dodge - Jul 14 2010â¢â¢ Emailâ¢ Shareâ¢ PrintChart: Poll ResultsAttachment: Poll results and methodologyAmericans disapprove of U.S. President Barack Obama's handling of almost every major issue and aredeeply pessimistic about the nation's direction offering a bullish environment for Republicans in theNovember congressional elections.A majority or plurality disapproves of Obama's management of the economy health care the budgetdeficit the overhaul of financial market regulations and the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico according to aBloomberg National Poll conducted July 9- 12. In addition almost 6 in 10 respondents say the war inAfghanistan is a lost cause.Almost two-thirds say they feel the nation is headed in the wrong direction an even more sourassessment than in March when 58 percent felt that way. Two-thirds of independent voters arepessimistic while just 56 percent of Democrats offer a vote of confidence.""They don't see any solutions in sight"" said J. Ann Selzer president of Selzer & Co. a Des Moines Iowa-based firm that conducted the nationwide survey. ""They have been hammered by the economy and thereis a disconnect between the lives Americans are living and Washington. They seem to have lost hope.""Poll respondents are divided on their congressional preference between Democrats and Republicanswith both sides getting 43 percent support. Among those who say they are most likely to voteRepublicans are favored 48 percent to 40 percent. The Republican advantage is even greater amonglikely voters who view the election as exceptionally important with Republicans beating Democrats 56percent to 34 percent.Control of CongressFor the Democrats whd control Congress and the White House the survey shows the potential 'for lossesin November when voters will fill all 435 House seats 36 Senate seats and 37 governorships. Theoutcome could affect Â°Pam's ability to move his agenda through Congress for the two years leading upto his own 2012 re-election bid.The fate of incumbents will depend to some extent on what happens to the economy in the next fourmonths and whether unemployment drops much from its current 9.5 percent. A rising stock market couldhelp as well. So far this year the S&P 500 stock index has declined 1.8 percent.The public's disenchantment with the president's Policies doesn't extend to voter feelings about Obamahimself as he gets a job approval rating of 52 percent and personally is viewed favorably by 55 percent.Obama 48 remains more popular than any of the Republican figures tested in the poll and is topped onlyby Secretary of State :-- ;:!aity ant.cn and General Datd Petraeos the new commander of U.S. forces inAfghanistan among a list of 15 people and political parties reviewed.Republican LeadersThe only bright spot for Republican candidates is for Louisiana Governor Eiob%) 1i:tele! who gets a 32percent favorable rating and an 18 percent unfavorable grade. Better-known party leaders such as formervice presidential candidate :a-et..n and former House Speaker Netfri: CirigPait both have negativeratings that outweigh the positive views.Although turnout in midterm elections is historically lower than in presidential races the electorate isinterested. Four- fifths of Americans who plan to vote say November's election is very or exceptionallyimportant.The likelihood to vote is strongest among older voters Republicans and those with the highest incomes.Among those 55 and older. three-quarters say they will definitely vote compared with 48 percent of thoseyounger than 35. Four-fifths of Republicans say they will definitely vote compared with 65 percent ofDemocrats and 62 percent of independents.Referendum on Â°barnaSeeking to capitalize on the intensity expressed by voters Republicans want to make the election anational referendum on Obama and the party in power while the White House and Democrats argue it isabout going forward rather than backward to failed policies.The challenge for Democrats will be to translate their vision of a better future into more positive feelingsabout the economy among voters. In the poll Republicans have the advantage among the independentsoften critical to winning elections. Among independents likely to vote Republican congressionalcandidates are preferred to Democrats 50 percent to 29 percent.""Anything that has been tried hasn't resulted in making anything better in the world where ordinary peoplelive"" Selzer said. ""That's a bad scenario for incumbents of the majority party.""Incumbent DisadvantageA third of poll participants say they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who has served inCongress for many years. About one-fifth of likely voters say the election is more about sending amessage while three-quarters say it is about picking the party that has the best ideas.""I don't know what these people are thinking in Washington"" says poll respondent Jeff Lockman 41 aprofessional golfer and Republican from Malvern Pennsylvania. ""They are going in 10 different directionsand they really don't know what to focus on.""The proportion who feel the nation is headed in the wrong direction is about the same as at this poin't in1994 when Republicans took control of Congress and 2006 when Democrats took over.The public also has soured on Obama's foreign-policy priority the war in Afghanistan. While the presidenthas ordered an expansion of forces to turn the tide in a conflict where he says the U.S. has a critical stake58 percent say it is a lost cause compared with 36 percent who say it can still be won. A slim majority ofRepublicans -- 52 percent -- say the U.S. can still win in Afghanistan while 71 percent of Democrats saythe conflict is lost.Afghanistan WithdrawalSix in 10 Americans say it would be best to stick with Obarna's plan to start withdrawing forces in July2011 while one-third say they remain open to keeping the same number of troops there or even addingadditional forces.Reflecting the belief among many that the war cannot be won a third of Americans say they have becomeless supportive of the effort there in recent months.The Bloomberg National Poll is based on interviews with 1004 U.S. adults ages 18 or older. Percentagesbased on the full sample may have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.:4:?r;yrâ¢ '.3cwrra:1 who studies public opinion at the A;-necicar Entarpr:F.:e institute a public-policy researchgroup in Washington cails the poll ""very very grim news for the Democrats.""At the same time she says one silver lining for Democrats is that Republicans have yet to convincevoters that they have a plan.Obarna VisitOne signpost for Democrats in the poll is the finding that just 26 percent of Americans say it would help aDemocratic candidate in their area to get a visit from Obama while 20 percent say it would hurt thecandidate and 54 percent say it wouldn't matter or they don't know.Obama's worst ratings are for his handling of the budget deficit where 59 percent disapprove and 37percent approve. It's his worst grade for that subject in any of four Bloomberg polls taken sinceSeptember 2009. The Obama administration expects a record budget deficit this year of more than $1.5trillion or 10.6 percent of GDP according to projections the White House released in February. It was$1.4 trillion for the 2008-2009 fiscal year which covers the end ofGecrge W. Bush's presidency andObama has said that the current fiscal shortfall as well as theunemployment rate are inheritances from hisRepublican predecessor's administration.""My biggest fear is we have people in government who don't have a clue about what is going on in theeconomy"" says poll respondent Jim Heeter 66 from Glendale Arizona. ""They have never run a businessor had to make a payroll.""Economy Health CareSlim majorities disapprove of Obama's handling of the economy and health care. When it comes tocreating jobs he gets 46 percent approval addressing problems on Wall Street 42 percent supportrunning the war in Afghanistan 46 percent approve and managing the BP Plc oil spill 46 percentsupport.Forty-five percent say they have become more supportive in recent months of tougher regulations for WallStreet. The momentum is heading in the opposite direction from the White House and Democrats on mostother issues.Almost half say they have become less supportive in recent months of federal money being loaned toautomotive companies to help them stay in business while 37 percent have become less supportive ofthe health-care overhaul passed by Congress earlier this year. A majority 61 percent say the nationshould wait and see how the health-care legislation works or leave it alone while 37 percent want to see itrepealed.Arizona Immigration LawAlmost half of Americans say they have also grown more supportive of allowing local law enforcement todetain anyone who can't produce proof of citizenship when stopped for an offense as is contemplated inan Arizona law. Cbama has criticized the measure and the Justice Department has announced it plans tosue Arizona.At least half of respondents also say they would be less likely to support candidates who voted to givefinancial assistance to the banking or automobile industries.Americans are roughly divided on whether they would be more or less likely to support a candidate whovoted against extending unemployment benefits because of concern over the cost. A measure providingsuch support worth $34 billion is stalled in Congress.Clinton PopularityThe disaffection with Obarna and Democrats doesn't carry over to all Democrats. Hillary Clinton 62 isviewed favorably by 61 percent of respondents and a quarter of Americans including 30 percent ofRepublicans and 21 percent of Democrats say the nation would be in a better place if she had beenelected president.The Tea Party movement which has been mainly associated with Republicans has lukewarm support inthe poll. A majority of 58 percent of all respondents says it would make no difference to them if acandidate was backed by Tea Party activists while a third of Republicans say that kind of backing wouldmake a candidate more appealing to them.Those who are more likely to think the Tea Party is a simplistic and misguided movement -- 44 percent ofall respondents -- include Democrats 65 percent and those with the highest incomes 52 percent.Independent voters are divided on whether it is misguided or has rightly identified that the nation would bebetter served by reduced federal government compared with 39 percent overall."

"See below....Nelson to support Don't Ask Don't Tell measure. Spoke with Byrd's people too....they think he is leaning tosupport it but would know for sure later today.Nelson to back 'Don't ask' repealBy: Jen DiMascioMay 26 2010 12:08 PM EDTNebraska Sen. Ben Nelson (D) will back repeal of don't ask don't tell likely putting repeal proponents over the top intheir quest to end the ban on gays serving openly in the military.""I don't believe that most Nebraskans want to continue a policy that not only encourages but requires people to bedeceptive and to lie. The 'Don't Ask Don't Tell' policy does just that"" Nelson said. ""It also encourages suspicion andsenior officers to look the other way. In a military which values honesty and integrity this policy encourages deceit.""""I will support the Lieberman compromise because it removes politics from the process. It bases implementation of therepeal on the Pentagon's review and a determination by our military leaders that repeal is consistent with militaryreadiness and effectiveness and that the Pentagon has prepared the necessary regulations to make the changes"" hesaid adding that he spoke with Defense Secretary Robert Gates about the issue.""He advised that while he preferred waiting until the study is completed he can live with this compromise"" Nelson said.Given statements made by Sens. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) that they too willvote for repeal Nebraska's Nelson would be the critical 15th vote required for repeal to be included in the defenseauthorization bill.Their decisions were also made after earlier news this week that both the White House and Gates could live with acompromise amendment sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Pa.).""We thank Senator Nelson for his support and are extremely grateful.

"Up .05 Friday without any marketing!Current NewsPetroSun Announces Formation of Algae BioFuelsPetroSun Drilling Inc. (PSUD - News), an emerging provider of oilfield services to major and independent producers of oil and natural gas, announced today that the company has formed Algae BioFuels Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary. Algae BioFuels will be engaged in the research and development of algae cultivation as an energy source in the production of biodiesel, an economically feasible and eco-friendly alternative to petroleum-based transportation fuels. The R&D and production facilities for Algae BioFuels will be based in Arizona and Australia.""PetroSun's formation of Algae BioFuels is a forward-looking strategy,"" said L. Rayfield Wright, president of PetroSun. ""The 0pp0rtunity to produce a renewable energy product that will assist in providing a healthier planet for future generations cannot be ignored.""Biofuel is any fuel that is derived from biomass -- which contains recently living organisms or their metabolic byproducts. Biofuel is a renewable energy source, unlike other natural resources such as petroleum, coal and nuclear fuels. Agricultural products specifically grown for use as biofuels include corn and soybeans.Extensive research is currently being conducted to determine the utilization of microalgae as an energy source, with applications being developed for biodiesel, ethanol, methanol, methane and even hydrogen. Independent studies have demonstrated that algae is capable of producing 30 times more oil per acre than the current crops now utilized for the production of biofuels. Algae biofuel contains no sulfur, is non-toxic and highly biodegradable.The Office of Fuels Development, a division of the Department of Energy, funded a program from 1978 through 1996 under the National Renewable Energy Laboratory known as the ""Aquatic Species Program."" The focus of this program was to investigate high-oil algae that could be grown specifically for the purpose of wide-scale biodiesel production. Some species of algae are ideally suited to biodiesel production due to their high oil content, in excess of 50%, and extremely rapid growth rates.One of the biggest advantages of biodiesel, compared to many other alternative transportation fuels, is that it can be used in existing diesel engines, which relieves automotive manufacturers of having to make costly engine modifications. Biodiesel can also be mixed, at any ratio, with conventional petroleum diesel. As a result, the alternative fuel can be used in the current distribution infrastructure, replacing petroleum diesel either wholly, or as a diesel fuel blend with minimal integration costs.About PetroSunPetroSun's current operations are concentrated in the Ark-La-Tex region with plans to expand into New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Australia in 2006. PetroSun provides a comprehensive array of products and services to the oil industry. The company's cutting-edge technologies, combined with a proven ability to apply them effectively and safely within a disciplined ROI framework, creates long-term value for PetroSun shareholders and partners. PetroSun is headquartered in Phoenix."

"H: Jim Fellows told me he was at your speech and thrilled by it. He's just returned from three years in China. He didn'texpect you would be so frank. Here's his post on The Atlantic website. Sidhttp://jamesfallows.theatiantic.comiarchives/2010/01/a_momentous_40_hours.php#moreXr07:Hi!!ary Clinton's ""Internet freedom speech iVianA momentous 40 hours leading to Clinton/China/Internet21 Jan 2010 04:12 pmApart from two obvious pieces of momentous news in the past day-and-a-half -- the new junior Senator fromMassachusetts and the new ckv V. V5-rvi-c.:! (by which I mean today's lamentable straight-party-line Supreme Courtruline;that removes limits from direct corporate underwriting of political campaigns) -- there is one other event today thatwill have big ripple effects. i mean SecState Hillary Clinton's speech this morning about ""Internet Freedom"" mentioned;:lere and with a prelude discussionI'm not going to take time for a thorough gloss of the speech. Instead I highly recommend reading the full text lette orwatching the official video .'tere. And for now some of the main points while listening (and noting main points down in realtime with the handy 'uiveaSccibe pen.)- In contrast to the dreamy Internet optimism of a decade or so ago -- I'm not naming names but I remember! -- whenmany people imagined that info technology by itself would undermine oppression and bring the world together Clintonstarted off with a very astringent reminder that this technology like others was neither good or bad in itself and is alreadybeing used in both helpful and destructive ways:""Amid this unprecedented surge in connectivity we must also recognize that these technologies are notan unmitigated blessing. These tools are also being exploited to undermine human progress and politicalrights. Just as steel can be used to build hospitals or machine guns or nuclear power can either energizea city or destroy it modern information networks and the technologies they support can be harnessed forgood or for ill. The same networks that help organize movements for freedom also enable al-Qaida tospew hatred and incite violence against the innocent. And technologies with the potential to open upaccess to government and promote transparency can also be hijacked by governments to crush dissentand deny human rights.""And a very nice pivot out of this section effective because it's so blunt and plain:""On their own new technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress but theUnited States does.""- Underscoring the ""this is a big deal"" tone of the speech she enumerated the ""Four Freedoms"" that FDR proclaimed in1941 as part of the struggle for the world's future and said there were a comparable set of Four Freedoms for theInternet age. Check out the speech yourself for details.- The China surprise: the speech was a more frontal challenge to Chinese internet and overall censorship policy than Iexpected and than I recall in other US-China interactions in a very long time. For instance early in the speech anitemization of the places where suppression is getting worse:""In the last year we've seen a spike in threats to the free flow of information. China Tunisia andUzbekistan have stepped up their censorship of the Internet. In Vietnam access to popular socialnetworking sites has suddenly disappeared. And last Friday in Egypt 30 bloggers and activists weredetained.""Tunisia Uzbekistan Vietnam Egypt -- this is not the grouping of countries that the Chinese government in its recentsense of rise to superpower status is used to being lumped with. Compared to the US as a financial power OK;overtaking japan in economic size yes; being a crucial player in environmental negotiations.. all that is one thing.Bracketed in the same sentence with Tunisia and Uzbekistan is different. Sentences like this don't appear in formal big-deal SecState addresses by accident.Other passages to the same effect:""As I speak to you today government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words fromthe records of history. But history itself has already condemned these tactics....""Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economyour government and our civil society. Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should faceconsequences and international condemnation....""And then the Google section itself.I had wondered whether the speech would mention Google by name -- and had reason to think it might not. (Mainargument forleavina it implicit rather than referring directly to the Google case: in the company's ongoing efforts to find a""illvineyiftaiv_in"" acceptable way to remain in China rather than a lose-lose-lose permanent split its not necessarily a helpto have the U.S. government standing officially by its side. ) But the way Sec. Clinton introduced the point was significant:as a proxy for China's own ability to H.totentiai and sustain its economic rise:""To use market terminology a publicly listed company in Tunisia or Vietnam that operates in anenvironment of censorship will always trade at a discount relative to an identical firm in a free society. Ifcorporate decision makers don't have access to global sources of news and information investors willhave less confidence in their decisions over the long term. Countries that censor news and informationmust recognize that from an economic standpoint there is no distinction between censoring politicalspeech and commercial speech. If businesses in your nations are denied access to either type ofinformation it will inevitably impact on growth.""Increasingly U.S. companies are making the issue of internet and information freedom a greaterconsideration in their business decisions. I hope that their competitors and foreign governments will payclose attention to this trend. The most recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal ofinterest. And we look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions thatled Google to make its announcement. And we also look for that investigation and its results to betransparent.""The Internet has already been a source of tremendous progress in China and it is fabulous. There areso many people in China now online. But countries that restrict free access to information or violate thebasic rights of internet users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century. Now theUnited States and China have different views on this issue and we intend to address those differencescandidly and consistently in the context of our positive cooperative and comprehensive relationship.""There's a lot more in the speech including about terrorism disaster relief religion etc -- but it's there for the reading.Back to the to-do list for me now.Peirmalink.Share This"
" For succinct introduction, I am Dr. Henry Salami of the above named Section of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (FRN). The presidency has mandated the Audit Section to handle all foreign Contract awarded and commissioned since 1995 till date. Based on that your file has been forwarded to my office for review and subsequent payment to those contracts that was genuinely awarded and commissioned.Based on the review carried out on your claim, I discovered that the claim you are laying was grossly over-invoiced and inflated to that magnitude by some officials who contacted you to provide an account to receive the fund simply because the code of conduct bureau does not permit civil servants to run or operate foreign account. You are presented to receive the fund as the beneficiary. I have discovered that at no time did you execute any contract for the Federal Republic of Nigeria, that you are contacted by some officials who presented you as the beneficiary just because Contract payment falls within their area of jurisdiction. Their aim is to divert the fund for you all to share mutually. I discovered and decided to contact you though you might find it difficult to believe but it is just the hard truth and so much money has been spent in these matter.  I am contacting you just for one reason that the fund can still be paid if I recommend because my discovery has not be revealled to anyone yet and I don't want to cancel the payment outrightly because it will not go down well with you. I want to let you know that the fund can be paid if you are ready to follow my advise and work secretly with me due to the fact that I have interest in the fund . I want to benefit from it, so let me know what will be my share out of it then I will go ahead and correct the anomalies and your past mistakes for the fund to be paid to you in seven working days.I am writing you with the spirit that you have seen that this is the truth but it will be very difficult to believe. As an Auditor attached to the Presidency, I am interested in the fund and I will like us to do the business together then I will write a favourable report about the claim for the immediate release of the fund or I will put up a report that will lead to the total cancellation of the payment. I know you have lost much money in Lobbying the officials to get the approvals.At the precise moment, the claim has been processed, we are irrevocably mandated to debit the Federal Government account.I will be expecting your call urgently on my direct No. +234 802 6944656 for us to discuss verbally for it might interest you to note that seven working day from the moment you acknowledge the receipt of this mail and agree on my terms will be enough to confirm the fund in your account provided you abide by my rules and also maintain the confidentiality of the transaction to avoid anything that will discredit my reputation.  I advice you discontinue any further communication with any other person for us to proceed in concrete fashion. Waiting for your response as a matter of urgency as the 2nd  Payment Quarter will come to end shortly. Do reconfirm your current telephone. It is  for effective communication.   Revert with utmost urgency.Thanks,  Yours faithfully, Dr. Henry  Salami.Auditor of  the Federation. (FGN)"

According to Laws of South Korea, at the expiration of (five) years,the money will revert to the ownership of theSouth Korea Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as aforeigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. PhillipMorris so that the fruits of this old man's labor will notget into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will putyou in place as the next of kin. We shall employ theservices of an attorney for drafting and notarization of theWILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter ofprobate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide the will, then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiaryext of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share inthe ratio of 70%for me and 25% for you and 5%  for ExpensesIncurred in the course of the transaction .  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and with myposition as the credit officer guarantees the successfulexecution of this transaction.

"Barack Obama may support insurance mandateBy CARRIE BUDOFF BROWN I 6/3/09 3:42 PM EDTUpdated: 6/3/09 11:22 PM EDTAs a presidential candidate Barack Obama scoffed at Hillary Rodham Clinton's proposal to require people tobuy health insurance.""(If) they can't afford it they just don't get it"" Obama said during the primary arguing that a mandate wouldnot work unless insurance costs were lowered first.For the first time Obama confirmed Wednesday that he plans to stake out a different position as president.In a letter to two leading Democratic senators Obama said he could support a mandate on individuals to buycoverage as long as Congress exempted those who could not afford it. This marks a shift from his stance duringthe campaign when he tussled repeatedly with Clinton on the issue. She proposed an individual mandate andhe did not.""I share the goal of ending lapses and gaps in coverage that make us less healthy and drive up everyone's costsand I am open to your ideas on shared responsibility"" Obama wrote. ""But I believe if we are going to makepeople responsible for owning health insurance we must make health care affordable.""""If we do end up with a system where people are responsible for their own insurance we need to provide ahardship waiver to exempt Americans who cannot afford it"" Obama wrote.Detailing his positions on various health care proposals for the first time as president Obama also saidAmericans should be able to choose between public and private insurance plans in a reformed health caresystem.""I strongly believe that Americans should have the choice of a public health insurance option operatingalongside private plans"" he wrote. ""This will give them a better range of choices make the health care marketmore competitive and keep insurance companies honest.""He offered qualified support for a mandate on employers to provide insurance or pay a fee to the government.Employers ""have a responsibility to support health insurance for their employees"" Obama wrote but smallbusinesses should be exempt.Obama's positions on these issues were not entirely surprising but his decision to weigh in beforecongressional Democratic leaders released a single bill was unexpected. Prior to the letter Obama and his aideshad declined to say specifically where he stood on various issues including the public plan and individualmandate saying they wanted Congress to lead the way in writing a bill.But Democrats have been anxious for the president to take a more public stance and the letter provides theguidance that many in Congress had been craving as House and Senate committees move closer to releasingdraft bills.""The president says get it done. Get it done right because we only get one chance"" said Sen. Barbara Mikulski(D-Md.) a member of the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee. ""The letter essentiallysynthesizes what the president is saying.""He outlined the parameters in a letter to Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and HealthEducation Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.).Obama's endorsement of a public insurance option could boost the controversial proposal and serve as catalystfor the Democratic base as the president kicks off a grassroots campaign Saturday.""It's clear that the Republican resistance to a public plan hasn't softened President Obama's support for one""Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. ""This strengthens the hand of those of us advocating for apublic option which is the only way to keep the private insurers' feet to the fire.""Despite almost uniform opposition from Republicans on the public plan the president wrote in the letter that heremains ""hopeful that many Republicans"" would back an overhaul bill.Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee struck an optimistic tone ina statement saying the letter ""doesn't draw lines in the sand"" and ""is helpful because of his statements thatreform legislation needs to have bipartisan support.""However the letter is likely to incite opponents who have been frustrated by Obama's lack of specifics.Indeed on Thursday morning Conservatives for Patients' Rights will begin airing a new TV ad called""Bulldozer"" which says a ""government-run plan"" will drive private insurers out of business and eliminateconsumer choices.Back to topRead more: ""Barack Obama may support insurance mandate - Carrie Budoff Brown - POLITICO.com"" -http://www.politico.comews/stories/0609/23298.html#ixzz0HQhr4KMx&A"

"  Dear Sir/Madam, I am the expert director heading Investments and Portfolio Management in the above-mentioned firm in Switerland. I am contacting you in view of an urgent assistance to carry out a pending transaction, which will develop a cordial business relationship between you and me. One of my clients whom I have personally managed his portfolio for 10 years now was a victim of a fatal car crash. His name is Late Mr Saud Ed Abad AlKharj, he was survived by a fiance and a two-year-old son from her as they intended getting married but where trying to be cautious because of Islamic law attitude on adultery. This were his only family and no next of kin, as he was the only child of Late Sheikh Hamza Al Kharj Al Faisal, who received royalties from the Kuwaiti Government on one of his fields which oil was discovered and subsequently explored (the Al Jazriah Oil Field). All subsequent investigation to find a next of kin was privately conducted by me and was futile. It was at this juncture that I and other officials Managing his portfolio and 2 bank managers where he had his accounts now decided to make this proposal and transfer ownership of the portfolio to an Agreeing party as beneficiary to the portfolio of the deceased. The reason why ownership cannot be transferred to his wife to be and only son is that Islamic law will not recognize such and if an attempt is made on that it may put her in trouble with the authorities for giving birth outside marriage. So we have decided to help her by making this proposal and making sure she gets a substantial part of Late Mr Saud Alkharjï¿½s property for her and her son. You must be asking where I got your mail address, it was made available to me by a junior director Mrs Cynthia Philips in charge of customer services on request for contacts for investment expansion for a client but she is not aware of this contact. All records and accounts regarding the assets of deceased were managed by me for 10 years running, if you are interested to assist us, all I will do is to incorporate in the old records recognizing you as the only beneficiary. The banking law here stipulates that if such portfolio remains unclaimed after four years it will go to the public department. The need for a foreigner as beneficiary is occasioned by the fact that the deceased was not permanently resident in Switzerland. For your assistance, we made up of I, 2 senior directors in my firm and 2 bank managers in banks which the Kuwaiti Government pay royalties, accruing to the deceased have agreed in fairness to make available 25% of all bank funds cleared and 15% of the royalties which you will continue to receive on behalf of the deceased as sole beneficiary every year. However we do not intend to share any interest with you as far as the estates and property are concerned, as they will be going to the surviving wife and child. If you are okay with the above explanations, you may reply us including all your contact telephone and fax numbers so that we may confirm you genuine, after which we will make more information available to you on how we will proceed. I must further assure you that this transaction is 100% legitimate and the modalities for this transaction is being handled by top executives which assure a risk free transaction.Kindly visit my firms website at www.royaltrust.com. We await your timely response. Best Regards DR PETER CLAPTON"

"Dear sir,As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, Ibelieve everyone will die someday. My name is IDRIS UMAR a merchant inDubai, in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It hasdefiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about afew months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularlylived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not evenmyself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I wasalways hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was theonly thing I cared for.But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life thanjust wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe whenGod gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life adifferent way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I havewilled and given most of my property and assets to my immediate andextended family members as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided togive alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the lastgood deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charityorganizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health hasdeteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once askedmembers of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the moneywhich I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, theyrefused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust themanymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit ofeighteen million dollars $18,000,000,00 that I have with afinance/SecurityCompany abroad.I will want you to help me collect thisdeposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.I have set aside 10% for you and for your time.God be with you.

"Greetings from the beautiful land of Zimbabwe.I am Joseph Made of Lands, Agriculture, & Rural Resettlement ministry ofZimbabwe.As a member of cabinet and former stuanch supporter of President Mugabe'sgovernment I was opportuned to be in the know as to what led to thestruggle for farm lands and subsequent fall out of my government with theWestern world. As of today I would be more than glad if the case of whathappened can be reversed as I have come to see that it was all in pursuitof the selfish interest of one man, the president!After all said and done, it has become obvious that my president like anyother African leaders needed to make sure that he remains in power to notjust consolidate his fortunes but also to make sure that he bleeds thecountry to death by siphoning the money meant for developmentalinfrastrure abroad. Of course with the help of some foreigners who do notsee anythng wrong in helping him steal the country blind. I may very well be sounding like a disgruntled and dis-appointed personbut the truth is that he has shifted his gaze from the foreigners to hisown very people. He sees any suggestions or opinions that does not agreewith his own has been that of a sabortuer and the person therefore mustbe purnished. In other words, we the followers have come to realise thathe feels threatened by not just our presence but coupled with the factthat most of us are privy to what transpired and are very much aware ofthe movement of large sums of money abroad.As it stands now I and many others are of the strong opinion that sooneror later it will be our turn to be flushed out of the composition ofmembers of cabinet and replaced with loyals who obviously have sworn to anoath of allegiance and loyalty via fetish and ritualistic methods. Thisbeing the norm does not appeal to some of us and therefore we are nowtargets to be dismissed/disgraced from service or face possibleextermination.I have contacted you on the consideration that I could discuss with youthe possibility of placing some funds with you for management purposeeither in your existing establishment or other venture to be undertakenafter due delibrations and under terms to be agreed upon. I will prefersthat this investment be made in your country if and when we have arrivedat a compromise.I sincerely appologise for writing you via this means even without priorestablished acquaintance. But I do beleive that as we get along you willcome to understand the reason for my writing through this means.I thank you for taking time to read my letter and hope that you willrespond soon with any inquiries that may help you decide on your next lineof action.Regards,JM.My Secured Email Address:joseph_m333@latinmail.com"

That is fine for me.
"     Dear One in Christ,  Good day, I am sorry to take your time and to disturb you. I am Mrs Susan Thompson ,from Kuwait.I am married to late Mr Eric Thompson, who worked with Kuwait Embassy in Ivory Coast for Twenty-Six years before he died in the year 2001,after a brief illness that lasted for only five days. We were married for Eighteen years with a duaghter (Lilian) who later died in a motor accident.     Before the untimely death of my husband,we were both born again Christians. Since after his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of (US$4.8 M )(FourMillion,Eight hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in a General Trust Account with a prime bank in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire. Presently,this money is still with the bank.      Recently,Following my ill health, my Doctor told me that I may not last for the next eight months due to my cancer problem.The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a  Christain organization (Church) or individual beleiverthat will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein,according to the desire of my latehusband before his death.     I want this fund to be used in Christain Activities like,Orphanages, Christain schools, and Churches for propagating  the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God  is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that ""Blessed is the hand that giveth"". I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision.       I am not afraid of death  hence I know  where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that ""the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace"". I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always.I don't want them to know about this development.With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank in Abidjan. I will also issue you the documents that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund.      I want you and the members of your Church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life.   Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein. Hoping to receive your reply.   Remain blessed in the Lord.   Yours in Christ, Mrs Susan Thompson.        ---------------------------------Start Yahoo! Auction now! Check out the cool campaign"

Me too. On Oz.On UK been in touch with people more this coming week. With Labour leadership contest going through summer there'sno real opposition which is just as well let Cameron/Clegg dig their own hole. Labour needs a new face after Gordon.Lots of internal tensions inside LDs will only get worse. They are seen as the enablers. This can't be sustained. Thisbudget isn't the end either.

Below is the final text of the Quartet statement which Lavrov Ban and Ashton have now agreed to release *without acall.* Sounds like your discussion with Lavrov did the trick:The Quartet re-affirms that the current situation in Gaza including the humanitarian and human rights situation of thecivilian population is unsustainable unacceptable and not in the interests of any of those concerned. The Quartetreiterates its call for a solution that addresses Israel's legitimate security concerns including an end to weaponssmuggling into Gaza; promotes Palestinian unity based on the Palestine Liberation Organization commitments and thereunification of Gaza and the West Bank under the legitimate Palestinian Authority; and ensures the unimpeded flow ofhumanitarian aid commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza consistent with United Nations Security Councilresolution 1860 (2009). The Quartet declares its readiness to work closely with Israel the Palestinian Government andinternational donors in order to achieve sustainable economic development on the basis of the full implementation ofthe Agreement on Access and Movement of 2005 and in the broader perspective of the two-state solution.Consistent with these objectives the Quartet and the Quartet Representative have worked with Israel as well asconsulting the Palestinian Authority Egypt and other concerned parties to effect a fundamental change in policy inGaza. The new policy towards Gaza just announced by the Government of Israel is a welcome development. The Quartetnotes that the elaboration of further details and modalities of implementation will be important in ensuring theeffectiveness of the new policy. Full and effective implementation will comprise a significant shift in strategy towardsmeeting the needs of Gaza's population for humanitarian and commercial goods civilian reconstruction andinfrastructure and legitimate economic activity as well as the security needs of Israel. The Quartet will continue to workwith Israel the Palestinian Authority and other concerned parties to ensure these arrangements are implemented asquickly as possible. The Quartet affirms that much work remains to achieve fully the solution stated above and inconsultation with the concerned parties it will monitor closely the implementation of the policy in all its aspects. It willactively explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza encourage involvement of the PA at the crossings andpromote greater commerce between the West Bank and Gaza.The Quartet stresses the importance of United Nations and other international interventions as well as the work of localnon-governmental organizations to be expanded in Gaza to meet urgent civilian needs and calls on all parties to fullyenable this work.The Quartet recognizes that Israel has legitimate security concerns that must continue to be safeguarded and believesefforts to maintain security while enabling movement and access for Palestinian people and goods are critical. TheQuartet commits to work with Israel and the international community to prevent the illicit trafficking of arms andammunition into Gaza. It urges all those wishing to deliver goods to do so through established channels so that theircargo can be inspected and transferred via land crossings into Gaza. The Quartet emphasizes that there is no need forunnecessary confrontations and calls on all parties to act responsibly in meeting the needs of the people of Gaza.The Quartet also calls for an end to the deplorable detention of Gilad Shalit in advance of the fourth anniversary of hiscapture on June 25; it further condemns the violation of Hamas' international obligation to provide him access by theInternational Committee of the Red Cross and demands that Hamas immediately remedy the situation.The Quartet also reiterates its support for proximity talks toward the resumption without pre-conditions of directbilateral negotiations that resolve all final status issues as previously agreed by the parties. The Quartet believes thesenegotiations should lead to a settlement negotiated between the parties within 24 months that ends the occupationwhich began in 1967 and results in the emergence of an independent democratic and viable Palestinian state in theWest Bank and Gaza living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.
Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi LibyaIt is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel in Benghazi Libya yesterday.Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and Foreign Service Information ManagementOfficer Sean Smith. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to alltheir families and colleagues.A 23. year veteran of the Foreign Service Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he sustained in the attack onour office in Benghazi.I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke eloquently about hispassion for service for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This assignment was only the latest in his more than twodecades of dedication to advancing closer ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as aPeace Corps Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded Chris was one of the first Americans on the groundin Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build the foundation for a new freenation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America'svalues and interests even when that meant putting himself in danger.Sean was a husband and a father of two who joined the Department tenyears ago. Like Chris Sean was one of our best. All the Americanswe lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this vicious and violent attack that took theirlives which they had committed to helping the Libyan people reach for a better future.America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country. We are honored bythe service of each and every one of them.1#titU.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739906Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

http://www.pallup.com/pol1/142730/Americans-Give-GOP-Edge-Election-Issues.aspxSeptember 1 2010Americans Give GOP Edge on Most ElectionIssuesGreatest Republican advantages on terrorism immigrationfederal spendingby Jeffrey M. JonesPRINCETON NJ -- A new USA Today/Gallup poll finds Americans saying the Republicans in Congress would do a betterjob than the Democrats in Congress of handling seven of nine key election issues. The parties are essentially tied onhealthcare with the environment being the lone Democratic stren th.The Republicans' advantage on most issues is an indication of the currently favorable political environment for the party.Of particular note is the parity between the two parties on healthcare an issue on which Americans historically haveviewed the Democrats as superior.A similar USA Today/Gallup poll conducted in October 2006 just prior to Democrats' major gains in that fall's electionshighlights the potential implications of these findings. That poll which includes several issues measured in the currentsurvey found the Democrats leading on all eight issues tested at that time including some usual Republican strengthslike terrorism and moral values.With Republicans now having the advantage on most issues the party may be poised to make major gains incongressional seats just as the Democrats did in 2006. Indeed Gallup tracking of registered voters' preferences in the2010 generic ballot for Congress continues to find the Republicans ahead of the Democrats as it has for the past fiveweeks.The Economy Matters MostThe Democrats' advantage on the issue of the environment is likely not something the party can leverage to improve its2010 electoral fortunes as Americans rank it at the bottom of the list in terms of its importance to their vote. Rathereconomic concerns are paramount with a majority of Americans rating the economy jobs and federal spending (alongwith government corruption) as extremely important.The Republican advantages on these economic matters range from a low of +5 on jobs to a high of +15 on federalspending. Terrorism -- the issue on which Republicans have the greatest advantage over Democrats -- is rated as veryimportant by 47% of Americans putting it in the middle of the list.Bottom LineRepublicans' perceptual advantage on most key election issues reinforces the party's advantageous positioning headinginto the stretch run of the 2010 election campaign. It is not clear whether Americans give the Republicans the edge onthese issues because they have confidence in the GOP to make progress in addressing the major problems facing thecountry or whether the ratings have more to do with the public's frustration with the incumbent Democratic Party'sperformance to date.The Democrats' hopes for improving their fortunes may hinge on convincing voters they have superior plans for jump-starting the economy the issue of uppermost importance in Americans' minds. That could be tough to do when afternearly 20 months of Democratic leadership in Congress and the White House Americans' opinions of the economyremain negative and have become more pessimistic in recent weeks.

"Snowe Supports Senate Ratification of NewSTART TreatyDecember 10 2010WASHINGTON D.C. â U.S. Senator Olympia). Snowe (R-Maine) released the following statement in support of Senateratification of the New START Treaty:""The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty known as New START was signed by the United States and Russia on April8th and transmitted for the advice and consent of the Senate on May 13th of this year. Since then the U.S. Senate hasheld 18 hearings and as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence I have worked with my colleagues toscrutinize this agreement and ensure any classified matters are properly vetted. Much has changed since the originalSTART was first negotiated in 1991 and as a result I have supported efforts to make certain that questions regarding ourability to verify Russian compliance with the Treaty's limits to develop and deploy effective missile defenses and tomodernize our nuclear weapons complex have been satisfactorily resolved.""I am confident that New START will provide predictability in our relationship with Russia and thus enhance globalstability and most importantly our national security. Therefore if the Majority moves to consider New START under aframework that allows for sufficient debate and amendments I intend to support the Resolution of Advice and Consent."""

I want to inquire from you if you can handle this transaction for mutual benefits/life opportunity for you and me.The transaction is about seeking your consent to present you as the next of kin/ beneficiary of the US$4.3 million dollars,(four million,three hundred thousand united states dollars), and who is a customer to the bank where i work.He died in a Kenya plane crash 2003.The Fund is currently in a suspense account awaiting claim, the bank made a public notice that they are ready to release this fund to any of his relatives abroad.I am as convinced as believing that you will provide me, the very needed urgent assistance, hence a viable bank account by which we can effect the transfer of the fund.Because,due to our position as top bank officials, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account, that is why i needed you to assist me in providing a foreign bank where this FUND will be transfered for immediate disbursement according to the percentages.You can view this site to know more.http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/hm_newsews.php articleid=35537.THEREFORE,by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL, top secret should be maintained please!,because i am still in the active service i do not need any form of implication especially now i'm in the verge of my retirement to endanger my carear at last!.Since we got the information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and laws.In that regard, i decided to seek your consent for this prospective opportunity. Have it at the back of your mind, that the transaction does not involve any RISK, and does not need much engagement from you, since i am familiar with this kind of transaction being an insider. Necessary modalities will be worked out to enable us carry out the fund claim under a legitimate arrangement. I have resolved to offer you 30% of the total fund, 10% for sundry expenses that may be incurred during the process of executing this transaction and 60% percent for me.I will give you more details about the transaction when I receive your affirmative response,more clarification information.

"Published on The New Republic (http://www.tnr.com)The Unnecessary FallA counter-history of the Obama presidency.â¢ John B. Judisâ¢ August 12 2010 I 12:00 amOn April 14 2009 as Barack Obama's standing in the polls was beginning to slip and as Tea Party demonstrators wereamassing in Washington for tax day protests the president gave a lengthy address atGeorgetown University explaining the""five pillars"" of his economic policies. The speech was intended to promote a memorable slogan for Obama's program thatwould evoke comparisons with Theodore Roosevelt's Square Deal Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and Lyndon Johnson'sGreat Society.Obama's contribution was to be the New Foundation. ""We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperityâafoundation that will move us from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest"" he declared. Obamawould repeat the phrase seven times that day and on many more occasions over the next months. At Obama's privateWhite House dinner with presidential historians that June the historians were no more impressed than the public withthe New Foundation as a slogan. ""I don't think it's going to work"" Robert Dallek warned. Doris Kearns Goodwin said itsounded ""like a woman's girdle.""One of these historians might have been able to forewarn Obama that the slogan had been unsuccessfully deployed by aDemocratic president once before. In his 1979 State of the Union address Jimmy Carter began ""Tonight I want toexamine in a broad sense the state of our American Unionâhow we are building a new foundation for a peaceful and aprosperous world."" Carter would use the phrase five times in the speech including in its conclusion where he askedmembers of Congress to join him ""in building that new foundation."" Like Obama's effort the phrase inspired at most afew underwear jokes and was then forgotten.Obama's evocation of Carter was obviously unintendedâbut the Man from Plains is indeed the specter now hanging overhis presidency. Of course Obama has already accomplished more in his first 20 months than Jimmy Carter did during hisentire presidency. But there is a disturbing political resemblance between the two presidencies. Both men ran inspiredcampaigns in which they positioned themselves above the scandals and partisan quarrels of their predecessors andinitially stirred hopes of a ""transformational"" presidency. But as presidents both men somehow failed to connect withlarge parts of the electorate.To be sure there are a number of very specific reasons why Carter and Obama landed in political trouble. Both mencontended with rising unemploymentâCarter with rampant inflation as wellâand voters' approval of a president and hisparty tend to track closely with changes in the economy. Carter faced friction in his own party and the rise of a powerfulbusiness lobby and Obama has dealt with a Republican Party that has frustrated his dreams of a post-partisan presidency.Yet the most important reason for their difficultiesâevident in their inept attempts to brand their programsâhas been aninability to develop a politics that resonates with the public.In the United States politics pivots around the allegiance of the middle class even as its identity has changed fromyeoman farmers and mechanics to store clerks office workers x-ray technicians and small business owners. They are inBill Clinton's words ""those who work hard and play by the rules."" They are the central characters in a populist rhetoricthat goes back to the early republic. It depicts the middle class as embattled and threatened either from forces below(impoverished immigrants welfare cheaters ghetto rioters) or above (Wall Street speculators state bureaucrats K Streetlobbyists). Populism can be embraced by Glenn Beck or Tom Harkin. It is intrinsically neither left-wing nor right-wing.Politicians such as Franklin Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan who found a way of using populism's appeal during downturnshave enjoyed success while those who have spurned it have suffered accordingly. If in circumstances like the present oneyou don't develop a populist politics your adversaries will use populism to define you as an enemy of the people. That'swhat Carter discovered during the stagflation of the late '70s. And that's what has happened in the last 20 months of theGreat Recession to Barack Obama and to the Democratic Party he leads.Obama took office with widespread popular support even among Republicans and some of his first efforts including the$800 billion stimulus initially enjoyed strong public favor. But that wide appeal began to dissipate by the late spring of2009. Disillusion with Obama fueled the November defeat of Democratic gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey andVirginia. By January 2010 it was a crucial factor in Republican Scott Brown's astonishing victory over Martha Coakley inMassachusetts.In the postmortem debate over these defeats some Democrats have blamed Obama's dogged pursuit of health care reformwhile the economy was hemorrhaging jobs. That may have been a factor but the real damage was done earlier. Whatdoomed Obama politically was the way he dealt with the financial crisis in the first six months of his presidency. In anatmosphere primed for a populist backlash he allowed the right wing to define the terms.As Obama was delivering his inaugural address the financial crisis was already in full swing; and it was already apparentthat financial speculation outright fraud and irresponsible and sometimes illegal housing-loan practices had played avery large role in precipitating the crisis. The public was up in arms. But instead of rallying the public against the ""moneychangers"" as Roosevelt had done in his first inaugural Obama taking a leaf from Jimmy Carter's infamous ""malaise""speech put the blame on the public as a whole. ""Our economy is badly weakened a consequence of greed andirresponsibility on the part of some but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a newage"" he declared.Over the next month Obama would periodically criticize bankers after embarrassing revelationsâat various times callingthe bonuses they gave themselves ""shameful"" and an ""outrage""âbut after hearing complaints about his rhetoric from thebankers he would back off. At a private meeting on March 28 with 13 Wall Street CEOs the president his spokesmanRobert Gibbs said ""emphasized that Wall Street needs Main Street and Main Street needs Wall Street."" And in hisGeorgetown speech Obama returned to his theme of collective responsibility. The recession Obama said ""was caused bya perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretched from Wall Street to Washington to MainStreet.""Obama's policy followed the same swerving course as his rhetoric. One week he would favor harsh restrictions on bankand insurance-company bonuses but the next week he would waver; one week he would support legislation allowingbankruptcy judges to reduce the amount that homeowners threatened with foreclosure owed the banks; the next week hewould fail to protest when bank lobbyists pressured the Senate to kill these provisions. But more importantly Obamaâinsharp contrast to Roosevelt in his first monthsâfailed to push Congress to immediately enact new financial regulations oreven to set up a commission to investigate fraud. (When Congress finally appointed a commission in July 2009 Obamaand his party put a milquetoast Democratic politician former California State Treasurer Philip Angelides in charge of it.)Obama's appointments also conveyed an impression that he wanted to let Wall Street off the hook. He appointed TimothyGeithner to be treasury secretary. Geithner claimed that he was not part of Wall Street but in his capacity as president ofthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York he had served under a board of directors headed by JP Morgan Chase CEO JamieDimon. As New York Fed president Geithner had been partly responsible for the decision to let Lehman Brothers gounder for the unpopular tarp program and for American International Group (MG) paying back its Wall Street creditorswith government money. Geithner chose as his chief of staff a former lobbyist for Goldman Sachs. Retiring DemocraticSenator Byron Dorgan told me ""Most Americans were reading about the massive compensations and bailouts and theadministration largely hired people from the culture of Wall Street.""By the spring Obama's apparent tilt to Wall Street had sparked a right-wing populist revolt in the country. The newlyformed Tea Party movement Beck and Fox News and a host of right-wing bloggers were leading the charge; but in a lessextreme form the general public shared their anger. In an early April New York Times/CBS News poll the publicdisapproved of Obama's aiding the banks by 58 percent to 33 percent. In this same poll public approval of Obama'shandling of the economy began to fall. Pollsters who did focus groups also traced disillusionment with Obama's economicpolicies to his handling of the financial crisis.Congressman Barney Frank who defends Obama's policies acknowledges that the president's political difficulties beganwith the revelation that MG which had received $170 billion from the government had paid out $165 billion in bonusesto the division that had brought the company down. Geithner had known about the bonuses but insisted there were nolegal grounds to block them. (It then came out that Geithner had pressured Senate Banking Committee Chairman ChrisDodd to insert a provision in the stimulus bill that protected the bonuses.) ""The pitchforks were out. It added injury toinjury"" Frank says. That's when public opinion of Geithner plummeted. According to a Rasmussen poll 24 percent had afavorable view of Geithner and 44 percent an unfavorable one.The public's view of the bank bailout and the AIG bonuses colored its view of the auto bailout the stimulus and healthcare reform. One of the rallying cries for the populist opposition to Obama was ""where's my bailout?"" (Obama himselfacknowledged that it was ""one of the most frequent questions"" he was asked in letters.) The auto program became abailout for the Big Three CEOs; the stimulus became a bailout of government itself; and health care reform was a bailoutfor the uninsuredâor ""reparations"" as Rush Limbaugh put it. Wrote right-wing blogger Michelle Malkin ""hardworkingcitizens were getting sick of being played for chumps"" by ""moochers big and small corporate and individual tramplingover themselves with their hands out demanding endless bailouts."" Obama and the Democrats were successfully portrayedas aiding ""the moochers"" but not the ""hardworking citizens."" In American politics that's a recipe for political disaster.Some in the White House political operation recognized in the late spring that the administration's economic efforts werebeing defined by right-wing populism and tried to push Obama to take a more populist tack. A group within the WhiteHouse began calling themselves the ""pitchfork gang"" but they would find their attempts to convince Obama to get toughon Wall Street or on insurance companies undermined by Geithner and by National Economic Council head LarrySummers who were worried about upsetting business confidence. ""There was a continual tension in the White House""says a person who was privy to the discussions. ""One week we would be very hot and then the next week we would dial itback.""By early January of this year Obama was clearly losing the battle for the middle class. According to a CNN poll 60 percentof Americans thought Obama ""had paid more attention to the problems faced by banks and other financial institutions""than to the ""problems faced by middle class Americans."" Only 28 percent barely more than a quarter thought he had paidmore attention to the middle class. As Brown surged ahead of Coakley in the polls the White House temporarily embraceda populist approach. On January 14 Obama called the bank bonuses ""obscene"" and said ""we want our money back."" In aJanuary 22 speech at Lorain County Community College in Elyria Ohio (a far cry from Georgetown) Obama used theword ""fighting"" 13 times and ""fight"" nine times. ""I will not stop fighting for you"" he declared.But faced with a falling stock market and anger from Wall Street Obama once again turned conciliatory. On February iohe said that he didn't ""begrudge"" the $17 million bonus awarded to Dimon and the $9 million to Goldman Sachs CEOLloyd Blankfein. ""I know both guys. They are very savvy businessmen.""Obama's reluctance to rail against Wall Street might have led to a watered-down financial reform bill or even no bill at allbut on April 16 the Securities and Exchange Commission indicted Goldman Sachs for fraud. The next week anemboldened Obama went to New York to criticize the bankers directly for their ""failure of responsibility."" As a result of theindictment and Obama's rediscovery of his anger Republicans became somewhat less obstructionist moderateRepublicans broke with the party's leadership and moderate Democrats fell into line. Congress produced a much strongerbill than the Democrats had ever expected.But Obama's embrace of populism has remained fitful and sporadic. After the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Verizon'sIvan Seidenberg the head of the Business Roundtable criticized Obama for being anti-business in June the presidentdispatched Geithner White House aide Valerie Jarrett and Bill Clinton to appease the business community. Obama hassaid enough to anger the CEOs but he has failed to convey to the greater public that he is fighting for them.Obama's unwillingness to buck Wall Street and the Business Roundtable along with his delayed and muddled response tothe BP disaster in the Gulf has eroded the public's confidence in his leadership. In Pew's midyear report card on Obama'simage the greatest drop from February 2009 to this June was in the perception of Obama as a ""strong leader."" Voters willsometimes tolerate policies they question from presidents like John Kennedy or Reagan whom they regard as ""strong""but not from politicians like Jimmy Carter whom they regard as weak.What of the other factors behind Obama's political difficulties? There is no doubt that if the economy were growing fasterand if unemployment were dropping below 9 percent Obama and the Democrats would be more popular and not fearing aNovember rout. But unfortunately the economy's sluggish recovery cannot be completely disentangled from the WhiteHouse's weak political performance.In January when the White House debated how large a stimulus to propose Christina Romer the head of the Council ofEconomic Advisors proposed a $1.2 trillion Keynesian jolt. David Obey the chairman of the House Budget Committeetold The Fiscal Times that Obama's Treasury Department asked initially for a $1.4 trillion bill. But the administrationfinally proposed a stimulus between $700 and $800 billion that included large tax cuts that were more likely to stimulatesaving than consumptionâand spending that would be unlikely to produce many jobs until the end of Obama's first term.In the stimulus's first year the administration spent only $17 billion of the $139 billion allocated forinfrastructure spending.Prominent economists including Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz made the case that a much larger stimulus wasnecessary to reverse (rather than merely reduce) the rise in unemployment and that if a modest stimulus failed to reduceunemployment Republicans would convince the public that the stimulus was toxic medication and would block additionalKeynesian measures. That argument has been proven sadly correct. Some White House advisers appear to haveunderestimated the depth of the Great Recession. Others seem to have doubted the administration had the political cloutto get more from Congress.But the White House might have gotten more if Obama had proclaimed a national economic emergency (which it was);framed the issue in terms of rescuing the middle class from damage done by Wall Street speculators short-sighted CEOsand Chinese mercantilism; and directly attacked Republicans as heartless obstructionists. When Obama belatedly madethis sort of case on the eve of the financial reform vote this year he got a much stronger bill than anyone had anticipated.So it's not clear that the failure to get a larger stimulusâwhich has ended up hurting the administration politicallyâwasn'titself a result of political timidity.The president has also suffered from an inability to explain to the public why he sought such a large stimulus and what hethought it could accomplish. Obama's New Foundation speech at Georgetown was soon forgotten. Afterward Obama tothe dismay of Democrats in Congress and some of his White House aides pretty much dropped the jobs issue. From thento Labor Day he devoted a July visit to Buffalo and an August stopover in southern Indiana to the issueâat a time whenthe right wing was mobilizing against him. Obama didn't just fail to develop a consistent narrative about the economy; hedidn't really try.Contrast Obama's attempt to develop a politics to justify his economic program with what Reagan did in 1982. Faced withsteadily rising unemployment which went from 8.6 percent in January to 10.4 percent in November Reagan and hispolitical staff which included James Baker Mike Deaver and Ed Rollins forged a strategy early that year calling forvoters to ""stay the course"" and blaming the current economic troubles on Democratic profligacy. ""We are clearing awaythe economic wreckage that was dumped in our laps"" Reagan declared. Democrats accused them of playing ""the blamegame"" but the strategy followed to the letter by the White House for ten months worked. The Republicans werepredicted to lose as many as 50 House seats but they lost only 26 and broke even in the Senate.Some commentators have noted Reagan's popularity was even lower than Obama's. But on key economic questions hedid much better than Obama and the Democrats are currently performingâand voters expressed far greater patience withReagan's program. According to polls even as the unemployment rate climbed a narrow plurality still expressedconfidence that Reagan's program would help the economy. On the eve of the election with the unemployment rate at apostwar high a New York Times/CBS News poll found that 6o percent of likely voters thought Reagan's economicprogram would eventually help the country. That's a sign of a successful political operation. If Obama could commandthose numbers Democrats could seriously limit their losses in November. But Obama has not been able to develop anarrative that could convince people to trust him and the Democrats.Why has the White House failed to convince the public that it is fighting effectively on its behalf? The principal culprit isclearly Barack Obama. He has a strange aversion to confrontational politics. His aversion is strange because he wasschooled in it working as a community organizer in the 198os under the tutelage of activists who subscribed to teachingsof the radical Saul Alinsky. But when Obama departed for Harvard Law School in 1988 he left Alinsky and adversarialtactics behind.The young lawyer who returned to Chicago and won a seat in the Illinois state Senate in 1996 practiced a very differentstyle of politics. Obama's principal accomplishments in Springfield were bills restricting lobbying and requiringvideotaping of confessions in potential death penalty cases. He was not a typical blue-collar bread-and-butter ChicagoDemocrat but the kind of good government liberal that represents the upscale districts of the city seeing in politics ahigher calling and ill at ease with (although not in open opposition to) the city's Democratic machine. He was also a post-racial politician who eschewed the hard-edged angry rhetoric of Jesse Jackson. (That too is oddly reminiscent of Carterwho partly campaigned in 1976 as the white Southern antidote to George Wallace's angry racial populism.)Obama carried this outlook into the U.S. Senate into his campaign for the presidency and then into the presidency itself.He is a cerebral dispassionate post-partisan; he wants to ""end the political strategy that has been based on division"" to""turn the page"" on the culture wars of the 1960s and the partisan battles of the 1990s. During the campaign his aidesjokingly referred to him as the ""black Jesus."" While he can tolerate and even brush aside conflict he is reluctant to activelyfoment it. ""In a time of crisis we can't afford to govern out of anger"" he declared in February 2009. During his campaignand his first year in office he held to a blind faith in bipartisanship even as the Republicans voted as a bloc against hislegislation. He is perhaps ill-suited in these respects for an era of bruising political warfare.His advisers have clearly reinforced these inclinations. In the campaign they fashioned him as the outsider candidate of""hope"" and ""change"" and have extended this strategy into the presidency itself. They see him as standing above party. In ameeting with congressional leaders last April senior adviser David Axelrod rejected the complaint that Obama accordedequal blame to Democrats and Republicans with his descriptions of the ""cynical politics in Washington."" Within the WhiteHouse top aides still speak of promoting the Obama ""brand."" Organizing for America the administration's campaignorganization which is supposed to be focusing on the 2010 elections recently devoted its resources to organizing partiesacross the country to celebrate Obama's forty-ninth birthday.These efforts to elevate Obama above the hurly-burly of Washington politics have been disastrous. Obama's image as aniconic outsider has become the screen on which Fox News the Tea Party radicalright bloggers and assorted politicianshave projected the image of him as a foreigner an Islamic radical and a socialist. He has remained ""the other"" that heaspired to be during the campaign but he and his advisers no longer control how that otherness is defined.The White House and cabinet officials he appointed have reinforced his aversion to populism. As Jonathan Alter recountsin The Promise: President Obama Year One Geithner and Summers repeatedly blocked attempts to get tough on WallStreet on the grounds that doing so would threaten the recovery itself by upsetting the bankers. For most of his first yearAlter writes ""Obama bought the Geithner-Summers argument that the banks were fragile and couldn't be confrontedwhile they remained in peril."" Its reluctance to come down on the bankers crippled the administration politically makingit far more difficult for it to get its way with Congress on a second stimulus program that would have boosted the recoveryand Democrats' political prospects. Bad politics can trump good policy.Populism has profound shortcomings as a worldview. It tends toward demagoguery. In its relentless focus on the middleclass it can ignore or stigmatize those below it. It can prove hostile to a long-range scientific outlook. A more populistObama for instance might have postponed the battle for climate change legislation or national health insurance andprobably would have taken a weaker stand on immigration. But populism has been an indelible part of the Americanpolitical psyche and those who are uncomfortable making populist appeals like Hoover or Carterâor more recentlypresidential candidate John Kerryâsuffer the consequences at the polls.If Obama's politics leads to a Republican takeover of one or both houses of Congress and even to a Republican presidentin 2012 then much of what Obama has accomplished could be undone. It's unlikely that a new Republican president andCongress would actually repeal the health care or the financial reform bill. But the former could be starved of public fundsand deprived of regulatory oversight; and the latter could be neutered by a hostile treasury secretary and by weak orhostile presidential appointees to the Securities and Exchange Commission or the new Consumer Financial ProtectionAgency. Reform legislation needs administrations and congresses committed to reform. That is where politics has to comein; and that's where the Obama administration with its aversion to populism has fallen short.John B.

"PIR <preinesThursday May 27 2010 11:48 PMJake SullivanRe: BrookingsSorryjust seeing this.Sanger has a blog item on the NYT site about the comment but more of a political take in that if you run for presidentagain your opponents will pull the Brookings tape. And a couple of wingnut blogs asking why you don't just volunteermore of your own money to taxes and that you chose Brazil as a ""socialist country that sides with our enemies as amodel."".

"HANG SENG BANK LTD.DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,CENTRAL HONG KONG,HONG KONG.Dear Sir,   Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 4years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like youas a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.  There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt alegalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bankaccount we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for anyexpenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind Regards,Mr. Wang  Qin___________________________________________________________________________Mail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site torrentgods.comr- http://torrentgods.com"
"Dear Beloveth,I am Prince Fayad W. Bolkiah, the eldest son of Prince Jefri Bolkiah,former Finance Minister of Brunei, the tiny oil-rich sultanate on the GulfIsland.I will save your time by not amplifying my extended royal family history,which  has already been disseminated by the international media during the controversial dispute that erupted between my father and his step brother,the sultan of Brunei Sheik Muda Hassanal Bolkiah.As you may know from the international media, the sultan had accused my father of financial mismanagement and impropriety of US$14.8 Billiondollars. This was as a result of the Asian financial crisis that made my father company Amedeo Development Company and government owned Brunei Investment Company to be declared bankrupt during his tenure in office.However my father was kept under house arrest, his bank accounts and private properties including a crude oil export refinery were later confiscated by the  sultanate.Furthermore, during this unfortunate period i was advised to evacuate my immediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution from the sultan and his security operatives, but before I could do that I was placed under house arrest by the Sultan and i have no access to a phone but I have a Palm V hand-held computer from which I am sending you this mail.Before my In-castration, I went ahead to dispatch the sum of Five Hundred Million United States Dollars US$500 Million in cash under special arrangement  into the custody of different Private security and Trustee company s for safe keeping abroad."
"U.S. Orders Diplomats to Sto Telling TruthhttrzquIrmw.trufhdig.coardreipiartliteir/us orders dirtbrnats to stoo teilinq truth 20'1012051Posted on Dec 5 2010Fake news by Andy Borovvibe;WASHINGTONâIn the first major policy fallout from the WikiLeaks disclosures the State Department has ordered allU.S. diplomats to ""cease and desist telling the truth until further notice.""""We are working overtime to fly to make sure that leaks like these don't happen again"" Secretary of State Hillary Clintontold reporters. ""But until we've got the leaks plugged it's incumbent on all our diplomats to put on their lying caps.""Clinton noted that since many U.S. diplomats are major political donors with long careers in the business world ""thisshouldn't be a reach for them."" But for those career diplomats who came up through the Foreign Service the StateDepartment will be holding a series of ""truth avoidance seminars"" led by executives of Goldman Sachs.Additionally Clinton said the State Department would install on all diplomats' computers new software calledCandorShield' which automatically translates truthful language into a less embarrassing truth-free version. Forexample she explained the software would translate the phrase ""two-faced weasels"" into ""trusted Pakistani allies"" andwould delete all references to French President Nicolas Sarkozy as ""Monsieur Shorty Pants.""Elsewhere Interpol issued this statement about its pursuit of WikiLea.ks founder Julian Assange: ""We will find JulianAssange and then we will hire him."""

"Dear Friend.Attention Please,I am Georg Path, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.The said amount was U.S 18.4M (Eighteen Million,Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and internet bills, while 50% will be for me.  Please, you have been adviced to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when I hear from you.I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,Yours faithfully,George Path._________________________________________________________________Dï¿½couvrez un moyen pour ï¿½liminez tous les virus de votre PC ! http://safety.live.com/site/fr-FR"

"Dearly Beloved in Christ,It is by the grace of God that I received Christ,Having known the truth, Ihad no choice than to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God for eternal life and in the sightof man for witness of Godï¿½s mercy andglory upon my life.I am Mrs Luisa Raymond the wife of Mr George Raymond, myhusband worked with the Chevron/Texaco in Kenya for twenty years before he died in the year 2001.Wewere married for twenty-seven years without a child. My Husband died after a brief illnessthat lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside mymatrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US $10.5M.(Ten million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) with a Bank in Europe. Presently, this money is still withthe Bank and the management just wrote me as the beneficiary to come forward to sign for the release of this money orrather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf if I can not come over.Presently, I'm in a hospital in Kenya where I have been undergoingtreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that Ihave only a few weeks to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizationsany where in the World. Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since myillness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them. Please, Ibeg you in the name of God to help me Stand and collect the Funds from the Bank.I want a person that is God fearing that will use this money to fundchurches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God ismaintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decisionbecause I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and Idon't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation wherethis money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am notafraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold mypeace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my soundless voice andpresence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about thisdevelopment. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of Attorneywho is in Europe as he will be the one to assist you in laying claims for this funds."

" Good day,It is my humble pleasure to write this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me. However, I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature in respect of this, I got your contact through an uprooted search on the internet. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the dayI am Stevens Bangura, son of late Mr John Bangura of Sierra Leone who was killed by the Sierra Leone's rebel forces on the 24th of December,1999 in my country Sierra Leone.When he was still alive, he deposited one trunk box containing the sum of USD$30 million dollars in cash (Ten Million dollars). with a private security and safe deposit company here in Abidjan Cote d=B4Ivoire. This money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond by my mother and she have already decided to use this money for future investment of the family.Recently, I rushed down to Abidjan after being able to locate where my late father kept the depository Agreement made between himself and the security company. I have confirmed from the security company that the consignment is in their custody, when I demanded for the release of the consignment to me in my capacity of being the son of Mr Bangura, the depositor of the consignment, I was told that in the absence of my father, the only person that can demand for the release of the consignment is my late father=B4s foreign partner on whose behalf the consignment was deposited.Meanwhile, my father have instructed me that in the case of his death, that I should look for a trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this money from C=F4te d=B4Ivoire immediately for investment .Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to transfer this fund into your Account, but I will demand for the following requirement:(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account wherethis fund will be transferred to in your country after retrieving the box containing the money from the custody of the security company.(2) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable business venture that would not require much technical expertise in your country where part of this fund will be invested?I am a Christian and I will please, want you to handle this transaction based on the trust I have established on you.For your assistance in this transaction, I have decided to compensate you with 10 percent of the total amount at the end of this business. The security of this business is very important to me and as such, I would like you to keep this business very confidential.I shall expect an early response from you.Thank you and God bless.Yours sincerely,Stevens Bangura_________________________________________________________ Gagne une PS2 !

Did you want to do another call before the 1115?
Oops my email acting up.Eap is asking you to call Thai foreign minister kasit regarding the case of the russian arms dealer viktor bout. Are you okdoing this call in the next day or so?Below is call sheet and I also faxed to the house.Purpose of Call: To underscore the importance we place on a the Royal Thai Government's successful appeal of thecourt decision rejecting the extradition of Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout to the United States and the importance ofhis continued detention pending the outcome of the appeal.Background: On August 11 2009 a Thai judge denied a U.S. extradition request of accused arms smuggler Viktor Bout(pron: BOOT) to face trial in New York for conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals and officers; acquire and use anti-aircraftmissiles; and provide material support to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The Thai AttorneyGeneral's Office will appeal the ruling. FM Kasit has been a strong ally on Burma and released a forward-leaningChairman's statement on behalf of ASEAN following ASSK's conviction.

As the conversation with these two ministers unfold you might make the point that we have come a LONG wayon Cuba so far -- and it would be really unfortunate to jam or embarrass President Obama after all the steps he'staken especially since what we are seeking is an entirely reasonable result.Agreeing to lift the 1962 sanction is a BIG step.

"Dear sir,  It is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in respect of the context below. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest (heart attack) while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit; the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband's properties is under the authority of the family's lawyer Tony Musa.  My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husband's wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the ""Personal will"" of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f!urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used; as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this ""SOS"" call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. "

It's worth you checking in with him before the meeting. His quick report of meeting with Allawi:1. Allawi said he pulled back from striking a deal with ISCI because he is concerned that the Shia representation istoo small and there is too much difficulty in trying to widen2. Allawi asked bill if he thought Maliki was serious suggesting that he was toying with the idea of a grand coalition3. Allawi will see Barzani on the 11thBill's overall take is that Allawi might now be looking to test the wider coalition proposition and is not as interested inthe ISCI gambit as first option.Bill has also seen AI-Mahdi Talabani and Zebari. He said there would be a good meeting with Maliki he's obviouslyfeeling confident but was firm on limiting role of Sadrists and need to bring Iraqiyya into inclusive govt.

There is an account opened inthis bank in 1994 but since 1998 nobody has operated on this accountagain. After a private and intensive investigation, I discovered that theowner of this account (Mr. Chapman Mark J.) was an oil merchant - aforeigner, who died since 1998 without having a beneficiary to thisaccount.http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/9809/swissair.victims.list/http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/americas/9809/08/swissair.02/My investigation proved to me he never informed any of his family membersabout this funds and he also did not have any next of kin to the saidfunds. The amount in this account is  Fifty Five Million Five HundredThousand British Pound sterling. Since no one has come forth to claimthese funds, the bank management is willing to welcome any foreigner whohas correct information to this Account which I will give upon receipt ofyour positive response towards my proposal. I assure you a 100% that thereis no risk to this business. After its conclusion I will retrieve alldocuments used in the transfer and destroy them in your presence, when Icome over to your account base for sharin of funds and possibleinvestment.Sharing will be 30% for you, 0.5% for any expenses incurred during thisbusiness 30% for charity organizations because this was one of the thingshe made known to me personaly before he died in the plane crash while theremaining 35% for me. As soon as I hear from you I will put up an annualleave so I could be able to facilitate the transfer of this fund to anyAccount of your choice.Contact me urgently for the way forward.Thanks.Andrew Clark."

Even my life and my wife and rest ofmy family are in danger. But it was not only me in thegovernment facing this hard time, all top thegovernment official were also maltreated after allthese, I patiently continued but I now see itnecessary to quit Africa with my family since thetrouble never make any step of reconciliation andAfrica continent is very unreliable now as thereï¿½spolitical and ethnic war in every part. Presently, Iam taking refugee with my family in Abidjan Cï¿½tedï¿½Ivoire under the United Nations refugeeumbrella. Unfortunately Cï¿½te dï¿½Ivoire is Havingpolitical unrest and many equally burst to piecessoonest, so I am tired and sincerely need your supportand assurance to invest wisely and relocate to yourcountry through your productive ideas and qualities. Ihave  $18.5 million US dollar to be invested in yourcountry  though your support and this existing amountis right safe and presently not in  SIERRA LEONE butlodge in the custody of a security and finance companysome where around west Africa region which I maydisclosed to you as soon as I receive yourcomplacence.I would be contented to have your private contact forsecurity reasons and I am very optimistic to release areasonable percentage of this amount to you for yourassistance.I anticipate your speedy response remain.

"sbwhoeopSaturday September 11 2010 2:20 PMH: On NYT website within last hour in tomorrow's paper. Paid TV ads please. SidSeptember 112010G.O.P. Leader Is Tightly Bound to LobbyistsBy ERIC LIPTONWASHINGTON â House Democrats were preparing late last year for the first floor vote on the financial regulatoryoverhaul when Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders summoned more than 100 industrylobbyists to Capitol Hill for a private strategy session.The bill's passage in the House already seemed inevitable. But Mr. Boehner and his deputies told the Wall Streetlobbyists and trade association leaders that by teaming up they could still perhaps block its final passage or at least waterit down.""We need you to get out there and speak up against this"" Mr. Boehner said that December afternoon according to threepeople familiar with his remarks while also warning against cutting side deals with Democrats.That sort of alliance â they won a few skirmishes though they lost the war on the regulatory bill â is business as usualfor Mr. Boehner the House minority leader and would-be speaker if Republicans win the House in November. Hemaintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation's biggestbusinesses including Goldman Sachs Google Citigroup R. J. Reynolds MillerCoors and UPS.They have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns over the years provided him rides on theircorporate jets socialized with him at luxury golf resorts and waterfront bashes and are now leading fund-raising efforts forhis Boehner for Speaker campaign which is soliciting checks of up to $37800 each the maximum allowed.Some of the lobbyists readily acknowledge routinely seeking his office's help â calling the congressman and his aides asoften as several times a week â to advance their agenda in Washington. And in many cases Mr. Boehner has helpedthem out.As Democrats increasingly try to cast the Ohio congressman as the face of the Republican Party â President Obamamentioned his name eight times in a speech last week â and as Mr. Boehner becomes more visible his ties to lobbyistscultivated since he arrived here in 1991 are coming under attack.The woman he hopes to replace Speaker Nancy Pelosi derided him on Friday as having met ""countless times withspecial-interest lobbyists in an effort to stop tough legislation"" that would regulate corporations and protect consumers.And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee through a spokeswoman charged that he ""epitomizes thesmoked-filled backroom special-interest deal making that turns off voters about Washington.""Mr. Boehner who declined to be interviewed for this article and his lobbyist allies ridicule such criticism as politicallymotivated by desperate Democrats. His actions they say simply reflect the pro-business antiregulatory philosophy thathe has espoused for more than three decades dating back to when Mr. Boehner the son of a tavern owner ran a smallplastics company in Ohio. And fielding requests from lobbyists is nothing unusual he says.""I get lobbied every day by somebody"" he said last month after a speech in Cleveland. ""It could be by my wife. It could bethe bellman. It goes on all day everyday everyplace.""Mr. Boehner â a 60-year-old perpetually tanned sharply tailored chain-smoking golfer â is not as fiery as NewtGingrich or as unrelenting an arm-twister as Tom DeLay two of his Republican predecessors in top House posts. It is hisreputation as a ""Chamber of Commerce"" Republican and his fund-raising skills â he has raised $36 million forRepublican causes during this election cycle more than almost anyone else in his party â that explain in part his rise.If elected as his party's leader in the House Mr. Boehner will certainly lean on his industry allies for help as he buildscoalitions necessary to push legislation through Congress his office acknowledges. His friends say there is nothing wrongwith that.""Does he have a lot of relationships in this city? Yes absolutely"" said Mark lsakowitz a friend whose Republican firmrepresents more than three dozen financial telecommunications energy and consumer products companies as diverseas Coca-Cola and Zurich Financial Services. ""But I think all the good lawmakers do.""Mr. Boehner won some of his first national headlines back in 1996 after he was caught handing out checks from tobaccolobbyists to fellow Republicans on the House floor. Then the fourth-ranking House Republican Mr. Boehner said he hadbroken no rules and was simply assisting his lobbyist friends who were contributing to other Republicans' campaigns.His business-friendly reputation was enhanced through the weekly powwows he organized on Capitol Hill nicknamed theThursday Group a gathering of conservative leaders and business lobbyists whom he relied on to help push the party'slegislative agenda. The Thursday gathering was disbanded after a Republican power struggle that cost him his leadershipposition.But he continued to routinely meet with business leaders particularly in his role as chairman of the Education and theWorkforce Committee and returned to power as House G.O.P. leader in 2006. Several of the onetime Thursday regularsalong with some newcomers are among the close-knit group that routinely call on Mr. Boehner's office for client matterswrite checks to his campaign and socialize with him.That tight circle includes Mr. lsakowitz; Bruce Gates a lobbyist for the cigarette maker Altria; Nicholas E. Calio aCitigroup lobbyist; and two former aides Marc Lampkin and Sam Geduldig both now financial services lobbyists.The tobacco industry is particularly well represented with both Mr. Gates and John Fish a lobbyist for R. J. Reynoldsmaker of Camel cigarettes in the group. People affiliated with those companies have contributed at least $340000 to Mr.Boehner's political campaigns with Mr. Gates being the top individual donor among the thousands during Mr. Boehner'spolitical career according to a tally by the Center for Public Integrity.While many lawmakers in each party have networks of donors lobbyists and former aides who now represent corporateinterests Mr. Boehner's ties seem especially deep. His clique even has a nickname on Capitol Hill Boehner Land. Themembers of this inner circle said their association with Mr. Boehner translates into open access to him and his staff.""He likes to bring similarly minded people together to try to advance legislation or oppose it"" said Drew Maloney alobbyist at Ogilvy Government Relations. ""That is how you get things done.""One lobbyist in the club â after lauding each staff member in Mr. Boehner's office that he routinely calls to ask for help âticked off the list of recent issues for which he had won the lawmaker's backing: combating fee increases for the oilindustry fighting a proposed cap on debit card fees protecting tax breaks for hedge fund executives and opposing a capon greenhouse gas emissions.Still with Mr. Boehner and his party in the minority they often lost the fights.But despite the recent string of defeats on the House floor Mr. Boehner has benefited from his alliance with lobbyists.From 2000 to 2007 Mr. Boehner flew at least 45 times often with his wife Debbie on corporate jets provided bycompanies including R. J. Reynolds. (As required Mr. Boehner reimbursed part of the costs.)In addition over the last decade he has taken 41 other trips paid for by corporate sponsors or industry groups often topopular golf spots. Those trips make him one of the top House beneficiaries of such travel which has recently beencurbed as a result of changes in ethics rules in Washington.Mr. Boehner continues to travel to popular golf destinations on a corporate-subsidized tab although now it is paid forthrough his political action committee the Freedom Project. In the last 18 months it has spent at least $67000 at the RitzCarlton Naples in Florida at least $20000 at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Gainesville Va. and at least $29000 atthe Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin Ohio federal records show for fund-raising events.In June with the prospects for a Republican takeover of the House rising Mr. Boehner moved to accelerate his fund-raising effort starting what he called the Boehner for Speaker campaign. The idea was to use his high profile to drawlarge donations that would be mostly allocated to help elect other House Republicans.He turned again to the same group of lobbyists former aides and friends during a July meeting at the headquarters of theRepublican National Committee.""The wave is there there is a rebellion in the country and we have good candidates"" Mr. Boehner told his supportersone of the lobbyists present at the meeting recalled. ""But I don't want to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity becausewe have not raised enough money. They might be able to stop us with a wall of money.""Mr. Calio of Citigroup was among the first to write a large check. So far a party spokesman said the campaign has raisednearly $2 million. Mr. Boehner has helped raise millions more in the last six weeks for Republican House candidatesacross the country and the party appearing at more than 40 fund-raisers.The Boehner for Speaker campaign offers donors who give the maximum amount special perks like ""meetings withLeader Boehner and much much more.""But his lobbyist friends and former aides said these incentives did not mean too much because they already had plenty ofaccess to Mr. Boehner. They just now want to see him as the speaker of the House.""He knows this is going to be a tough election"" said Samuel J. Baptista a friend golf partner and lobbyist whose clientsinclude Goldman Sachs and Discover Financial. ""But people who underestimate him really do so at their own peril."""

"Here's a basic summary:It focused on citing the illegitimacy of US nuclear and nonproliferation policy and on highlighting that it is the nuclearweapons states which are to blame for both proliferation and global instability. The speech suggested that USnonproliferation efforts are a cynical attempt to divert attention from our aim to keep nuclear weapons for ourselvesand that even things like the Nuclear Summit are nothing more than such a veil. The speech made several pointedattacks on the USG from the USAF's security issue a few years ago to our use of nuclear weapons in WWII (making us""the most hated"" in history) to allegations of support for terrorism (including that only states who have and have usednuclear weapons could support nuclear terrorism). The speech offered 11 ""proposals"" most of which were previewedin Tehran press today. These include legally binding NSAs suspension of IAEA membership for those who threaten withnuclear weapons disarming all US nuclear bases support for a ME w/o nuclear weapons and restructure of the UNSC.The US del walked out -- with many partners -- in response to this speech."

Ok. Safe travels.
In your book tonight as Tab 4 of the materials for the USGLC event is a list I put together of all the key things you said inyour CGD speech and the parallel language in the PPD. It is really worth skimming; it shows at a glance how you set theagenda and won the day. As the Secretary who came in determined to elevate development you have a great deal totake credit for in launching the first national development policy. And as my PPD staff briefings with Gayle on the Hilltoday demonstrated the PPD sets the table beautifully for the QDDR.AM

"MR. KALADA HARTORIENT BANK (NIG.) LTD.IDUMOTA BRANCH LAGOS. - NIGERIA.Dear Sir,I am Mr Kalada Hart, Bank Manager of Orient Bank of Nigeria,Lagos Branch. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On September 6, 1997, a Canadian Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Jerry Sheldon made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Jerry Sheldon died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Jerry Sheldon did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one has ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Jerry Sheldon so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiaryext of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guaranttees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.Awaiting your urgent reply via my email.Thanks and regards.Mr.Kalada Hart"
"aned by Woodward's Fireby Leslie H. GelbSeptember 23 2010 I 1:32pmThe president and his team cooperated with the famed author's new book. Leslie H. Gelb on thefalloutâand how Obama's Wars shows the U.S. is stuck in an open-ended conflict.Lots of White House officials observed Bob Woodward Mr. First Draft of History repeatedly and boldly slipping behind theclosed doors of President Obama's most intimate advisers. They all knew what was happening. The president's men werehelping The Washington Post's sleuth write ""the inside story"" of how the boss masterfully managed the most trying ofHerculean laborsâthe war in Afghanistan. There's only one very big problem in dealing with Woodward in this manner:Once the boss opens the doors to spilling the secrets many of his subordinates feel liberated to ""tell their side of thestory."" By the time each has exhausted tales of his own heroism and the shortcomings of his fellow senior officials wellno one looks terribly heroic.Let's start with Obama who emerges from the pages of Obama's Wars as he isâbrilliant emotionless abstract focusedand confused a Chicago law-school professor in presidents' clothes. He obviously wanted Woodward to portray him as abrilliant intellectual leader of a government that was not giving him too much help in solving the Afghan mystery but thathe trudged on doing the best anyone possibly could under these terrible circumstances.The worst circumstance as Team Obama alleged to Woodward was that the Pentagon leadership and the U.S. generalsdid not give him the real choices he was asking for. He wanted options for troop increases below even far below whatthe generals were giving him. He didn't get them. He wanted a strategy for how U.S. forces would be drawn down afterthey reached their projected peak of about 100000 (more than three times the number George W. Bush left him). Themilitary didn't provide him with that either.As they say in Missouri ""Give me a break."" If the commander in chief of the United States doesn't know how to get whathe wants from the U.S. military he might want to do something about that. And some of the many generals in the WhiteHouse who he picked to guide him might have told him how to go about that task. To cut to the chase: Obama didn'tunderstand what he had to doâtell Defense Secretary Bob Gates to tell the generals either they meet the president'swishes or they will be fired. Republican presidents do just that. And so as Woodward describes Obama had to write thestrategy all by himself.This was and still is an awful situation that springs from two sources. One is that the president has just not been clearenough about his thinking and objectives for Afghanistan and the military and the rest of us must have real clarity topursue wars. Woodward has this right. Here are a few Obama quotes that illustrate the problem. The president toldWoodward that he didn't think about the Afghan war in the ""classic"" terms of the U.S. winning or losing. ""I think about itmore in terms of: Do you successfully prosecute a strategy that results in the country being stronger rather than weaker atthe end?"" What on earth does that mean? Or try this one to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) about whether the July 2011deadline to begin withdrawal was firm: ""I have to say that. I can't let this be a war without end and I can't lose the wholeDemocratic Party."" Does that mean Obama really believes in the war but his party doesn't? Or to White House aides:""This needs to be a plan about how we're going to hand it off and get out of Afghanistan."" So if he wanted such a plan heshould have gotten such a plan. He is president after all.Which leads to the second problem: When a president is not clear about a tough problem the military smells vacillations.And they sure don't like vacillation when it comes to dispatching their men and women to war. Americans don't fathomwell the military mentality. The military in most countries throughout history doesn't like to go to war; they like to build uptheir arms and overall strength. But once in war they want only more troops fewer restrictions on their use and above allvictory victory victory. Since Vietnam they smell only vacillation among Democrats and they don't like it. For their partDemocrats see insubordination and worse among the military toward them and they don't care for the suits either. It's nota happy circumstance. Woodward didn't explore this underlying reality which is critical for Americans to understand.breakAdThe White House clash with the military could get worse over the latest news about Gen. Stanley McChrystal's firing overnaughty things said about the White House to a reporter. According to a preliminary Army investigation the generalâandperhaps even his senior Army aidesâwere not the sources of those nasty quotes. It was some other guysâyou know theusual culprits the Navy and civilians. There will be further formal inquiries on this but nothing good will come of them.There's another important thread running throughout the Woodward account that I believe he gets more wrong thanright. That is Woodward's repeated insistence of open and bitter policy brawls in the good old Situation Room (the innersanctum for White House meetings) over Afghan policy. Mr. Instant Historian paints a picture of a war of all against all. Myinformation has always been that there was relative agreement on major policy. Based on my sources there is no doubtthat Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Defense Secretary Bob Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen were almostalways quite cordial and in full lock step. They along with the NSC Adviser Jim Jones and field commanders like GeneralMcChrystal and General Petraeus are the key players. Of course Vice President Joe Biden and Chief of Staff RahmEmanuel were the only regular critics of where policy was heading. The generals did lobby for their positions in publicâinadvance of presidential decisions. And that's a big no-no. But by that standard almost all Obama's top advisers did asmuch. The day after his West Point speech last December where he set the firm date of July 2011 to begin unspecifiedU.S. troop withdrawals almost all the advisers publicly stated that maybe one didn't have to take this date too seriouslythat everything was ""conditions based."" That group of rebels included Gates and Clinton.So if anything most of Obama's top counselors were more or less unitedâsometimes against where he seemed to begoing. Here is what Petraeus had to say to Woodward on the subject of goals and it's a stunner: ""You have to recognizealso that I don't think you win this war. I think you keep fighting. It's a little bit like Iraq actually.... Yes there has beenenormous progress in Iraq. But there are still horrific attacks in Iraq and you have to stay vigilant. You have to stay afterit. This is the kind of fight we're in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids' lives."" The brilliant general said as muchto others over the last year. It's enough to knock your socks off.So far there are no heroes to this narrative only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight onforever.Doubtless President Obama does not want to fight an open-ended war. He's sworn to that time and again and I believehim despite his history of calling for ""victory"" and ""defeat"" of the Taliban and al Qaeda. But what the Woodward bookdemonstrates is that Obama and his team just don't know how to get from here to there. So far there are no heroes tothis narrative only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on forever.Leslie H. Gelb a former New York Times columnist and senior government official is author of Power Rules: HowCommon Sense Can Rescue American Foreign Policy (HarperCollins 2009) a book that shows how to think about anduse power in the 21st century.

"FROM MR ABDUL LAZEEZSTANDARD TRUST BANK OF BENINREPUBLIC OF BENIN. WEST AFRICA. DEAR FRIEND  I am MR ABDUL LAZEEZ, the director in charge of auditing and accounting= section of Standard trust bank of Benin cotonou Republic of Benin in Wes=t Africa with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a =business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the en=d of the transaction .  During our investigation and auditing in this bank,my department came acr=oss a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in (=beirut-bound charter jet) plane crash on the 25th December 2003 here in c=otonou (replublic of benin) and since his untimely death the funds has be=en dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in= our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to t=his development.You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this= site which I got during my investigation; (http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD=/africa/12/26/benin.crash/index.html). Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself and par=tners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful dur=ing the time of execution. The said amount was US$24.1M(Twenty Four milli=on OneHundred Thousand united states dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through= a friends who works with the Ministry of Information here in Cotonou-Ben=in.  It is him who recommended your person to me to be viable and capable to c=hampion a business of such magnitude without any problem .Meanwhile all t=he whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of =kin to the deceased,get the required approval and transfer this money to =a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed informa=tion will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and wil=lingness to assist us and also benefit yourself to this great business op=portunity.  In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in t=his country as a civil servant,we are not allowed to operate a foreign ac=count and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time o=f transfer because I work in this bank.This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow wh=o will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a f=oreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on =his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the =correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted f=rom to your own designated bank account.  May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as =I have made arrangements for a successful arrangement as an insider of th=e bank before contacting you. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, y=ou will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% w=ill be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time =of transfer and also telephone bills, while 60% will be for me and my par=tners.  Please, you have been adviced to keep this a top secret as we are still i=n service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal w=ith you.  I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you conf=irm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for= subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indic=ated and further investment, either in your country or any country you ad=vice us to invest in.  All other necessary information will be sent to you on your acceptance to= champion this transaction with me.  I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible on my personal email add=ress stating your wish in this deal. Yours faithfully, Mr ABDUL LAZEEZReply To:mrabdullazeez@hotmail.com"

"My Dear,Greetings and l hope this message finds you well, and pardon me for contacting you this way , it is because of the urgent nature of my request.My name is Mrs. Mary Abavana and I am living with AIDS. Ever since my husband, Hon. Lawrence R. Abavana, former Ghanaian Agriculture minister died of AIDS and I was tested positive of the AIDS virus, the mass media wouldn't just let me and my family be. My children have stopped going to school because they could no longer stand the humiliations from fellow students. The embarrassment are getting on my nerves but what can I do? I would have loved to travel out of the country to a place where I will have peace and spend the rest of my life with my children but I couldn't make it for I am weak and severely sick. Moreover, no Embassy would grant me Visa to her country with my hairs withering and boils all over my body. View my family on the website:www.ghanacastle.gov.gh/President/castle_newsp_details.cfm?EmpID=476>From all indications, I know that my days are numbered. In the light of the above, I have contacted you to assist me to accommodate the SUM OF $15 Million USD and the 250kg of Gold which my husband acquired while alive and serving as minister and which he deposited as with a Finance and Gold company here in ghana for the up-keep of my children. I want you to safe-keep it for my children as they will be coming over to your country in due course to live and school. YOU WILL INVEST THIS MONEY FOR MY CHILDREN IN COMMERCIAL ESTATE OR ANY BUSINESS OF YOUR CHOICE YOU DEEM HEALTHY.For your effort, I am prepared to give you 25% of the total funds. I am looking forward to hear from you while thanking you for your anticipated cooperation in this regard.Please l will need your telephone number also.Kind Regards,Mrs. Mary Abavanayou can also write to me with;  maryabavana75@terra.com_________________________________________________________________Try the next generation of search with Windows Live Search today!  http://imagine-windowslive.com/minisites/searchlaunch/?locale=en-us&source=hmtagline"

"CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD.LAGOS, NIGERIAGOOD DAY FRIENDATTENTION:SIR/MADAMI am MR.VICTOR KOVIS, the Director of OperationsCHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD,LAGOS NIGERIA. Here inNIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high reputewith years of outstanding service to the people ofAfrica.I have resolved to contact you through this mediumbased on business proposal that will be of mutualbenefit to both of us. I got your particulars througha consultant company base on my research for atrustworthy and established person that understandsinvestment ethic for entering into a life timeprofitable joint partnership investment and alsoco-operation with confidence and trust that you willkeep the contents secret and divulged to any thirdparty.To be explicit and straight to the point. Some timeearly 1997, a reputable client of o! urs deposited aconsignment in our company's vault for safe keeping.And since then our client has failed to come forwardto claim his consignment, which has accumulated aconsiderable amount of money in demurrage.Consequently, in our bide to contact this client toredeem the demurrage which his consignment hadaccumulated we discovered that our client was theformer president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, whodied of illness after he was de-throwed in the sameyear the consignment was entrusted into our care.Since the death of our client President MobutouSeseseko, none of his benefactors has come forward toclaim the consignment with us, which means that non ofhis relatives or aids had any knowledge of thisconsignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided tosecretly open the two boxes that our client depositedin our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that thetwo boxes that were registered as treasure! r by ourclient actually contained a considerable amount ofmoney in United States Dollars amounting to aboutUS$30 million Dollar.

"US Congress warns Cameron over danger of failedUlster police dealYes vote on Hillsborough agreement would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast nextmonthDavid Cameron has been given a stark warning from Washington that dissident terrorists will be ""emboldened""to intensify their attacks in Northern Ireland and millions of dollars of US investment will be threatened if hefails to persuade the Tories' Ulster Unionist partners to endorse the final stage of the peace process.In a sign of deep unease in Washington at the Tories' electoral pact with the UUP a bipartisan group of USCongress members have demanded Cameron must ""aggressively"" encourage his partners to endorse the deal ina vote in the Northern Ireland assembly on Tuesday.""At this defining moment in the peace process it is crucial that all the political parties speak with one voiceabout their shared future"" the members of Congress wrote in a private letter to Cameron.Without a unanimous vote they said the province's elected officials would be sending the wrong message tothe people they represent and to the world.""Dissidents are trying to destabilise the political institutions and turn the clock back ... These dissidents willcontinue to be emboldened if they sense there is no political unanimity on the way forward ... The challenge ofbringing good jobs to Northern Ireland will be made more difficult if potential investors do not believe there ispolitical stability.""The letter by congressional leaders of the 41 million-strong Irish-American community has been passed to theGuardian before the crucial vote on last month's Hillsborough agreement between Sinn Fein and the DemocraticUnionists.A yes vote would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month in what the Britishgovernment has dubbed the final piece in the jigsaw of the 1998 Good Friday agreement.The congressmen and women whose views reflect the private misgivings of the US secretary of state HillaryClinton wrote to Cameron after learning that his electoral partners in Northern Ireland were voicing doubtsabout endorsing the deal. Clinton is said to be alarmed that Cameron has either failed or not bothered to warnthe UUP of the dangers of obstructing the deal.A Tory source said: ""David Cameron has consistently made clear that we support the devolution of policing andcriminal justice powers ... We welcomed the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein. The final details arefor the parties in the executive working as a four-party coalition to decide. We hope that between now andTuesday any outstanding issues can be solved.""The Hillsborough agreement was brokered last month under a system endorsed by the UUP when it was thelargest party in Northern Ireland. This says that any change must have the consent of 50% of both the nationalistand Unionist communities and 50% of the assembly.Sir Reg Empey the UUP leader who was one of the architects of the Good Friday agreement will meet hisparty's executive tomorrow night to decide how to vote.The deal could still be passed tomorrow without the support of the UUP because the DUP's 36 assemblymembers account for more than 50% of the unionist bloc. But there are fears in Washington that a no vote fromthe UUP seen as a moribund force until Cameron breathed new life into it would destabilise many members ofthe DUP and undermine support for the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers."

"Good Day,With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully, and have a general overview of my situation. My Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla!nd) to seek for political asylum.I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam. President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here.I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.Your role in this project, is acting on my behalf to clear the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.To know more about the struggle by UNITA to liberate Angola, click on the links below and read. http://www.the-idler.com/IDLER-02/3-16.htmlhttp:/ews.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africaewsid_1839000/1839252.stmSincerely,O.C.Savimbi."

"sbwhoeopWednesday August 18 2010 9:18 AMH: Interesting and relevant contribution to debate on interrelated jobs issue and China policy. Go back to your proposalson revival of manufacturing sector too. What is Bill's program on lm jobs you mentioned? If they won't listen he shouldsimply do an op-ed. SidDoes Thomas Friedman Have to Talk to ""Senior Economic Policy Makers"" to Get SoMany Things Wrong?Dean Baker is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington DC.Wednesday 18 August 2010 04:04Thomas Friedman begins his oiece 1Q(44v by telling readers that: ""over the past few weeks I've had a chance tospeak with senior economic policy makers in America and Germany."" This might lead readers to believe thathe is about to share some great insights that would only be possible for someone with special access to thesesenior economic policy makers.Readers with this expectation will be seriously disappointed. There is nothing here that is more insightful thanwhat can be found on the Washington Post's editorial pages on an average workday. Friedman rehashes theusual cliches with the usual lack of thought. In doing so he gets both the story of the recent past and thepresent seriously wrong.Starting with the past he badly misrepresents the prior business cycle:""we've just ended more than a decade of debt-fueled growth during which we borrowed money from China togive ourselves a tax cut and more entitlements but did nothing to curtail spending or make long-terminvestments in new growth engines.""The main problem facing the U.S. economy of the last decade was a lack of demand. This was in large part dueto the fact that China lent to us. China's lending was its policy of propping up the value of the dollar in order tomaintain its export market in the United States. (At the start of the decade the Clinton administration had alsotried to promote an over-valued dollar.) The over-valued -U.S. dollar made imports from China and othercountries very cheap in the United States and made our exports expensive in other countries. This led to a largeand growing trade deficit over most of the business cycle. The trade deficit replaced domestic demandpreventing the economy from approaching normal levels of employment (even with the boost from the housingbubble) until just before the crash.There is no reason whatsoever to believe that China's decision to prop up the dollar was in any way affected bythe Bush tax cuts. In other words neither the Bush tax cuts nor the growth in entitlements had anything to dowith our borrowing from China. The issue was China's decision to lend and thereby prop up the dollar. Giventhe weakness of demand through most of the decade these expenses could have been easily filled by domesticproduction without borrowing from abroad.Friedman does no better when he shifts the discussion from the past to the present. He refers to businesses'reluctance to hire as the result of ""unusual uncertainty"" a phrase attributed to Federal Reserve Board ChairmanBen Bemanke. Of course there is no reluctance to hire there is simply a lack of demand for labor. A reluctanceto hire would be reflected in an increasing number of hours per worker as employers sought to meet theirdemand for labor by working the existing workforce more hours.This is not happening. There is a modest uptick in hours from the low point of the downturn but the increasein hours per worker is certainly no more rapid than in other recessions and the average workweek is still farshorter in just about every sector than it was before the downturn.Later he tells readers:""America's solvency inflection point is coinciding with a technological one. Thanks to Internet diffusion therise of cloud computing social networking and the shift from laptops and desktops to hand-held iPads andiF'hones technology is destroying older less skilled jobs that paid a decent wage at a faster pace than everwhile spinning off more new skilled jobs that pay a decent wage but require more education than ever.""This is a great story -- social networking is soaring IPads are everywhere -- does Friedman have any evidencewhatsoever that this development has increased the demand for educated workers and reduced the demand forless educated workers? If so this would be the place in his column to present the evidence. Otherwise readersmight think that the 4.7 percent unemployment rate for college grads (nearly triple the pre-recession level)coupled with a decline in their real wages over the decade implies a reduced demand for the labor of highlyeducated workers as well as less educated workers.Friedman's proposed fix also seems a bit wide of the mark. He insists:""There is only one way to deal with this challenge: more innovation to stimulate new industries and jobs thatcan pay workers $40 an hour coupled with a huge initiative to train more Americans to win these jobs overtheir global competitors. There is no other way.""We better hope there is another way. A wage of $40 an hour would put a worker well over the 90th percentileon the wage distribution. Even if we double the number of jobs in this pay range -- an incredibleaccomplishment -- what happens to the other 80 percent of the workforce?Friedman then warns us of the challenge from Europe by getting Germany's past and present wrong:""Keeping up with Germany won't be easy. A decade ago Germany was the 'sick man of Europe.' No more. TheGermans pulled together. Labor gave up wage hikes and allowed businesses to improve competitiveness andworker flexibility while the government subsidized firms to keep skilled workers on the job in the downturn.""Germany clearly has done sorne changes that benefited its economy like work sharing and some that haven'tbut its past as the ""sick man of Europe"" is an invention of Friedman or his highly placed sources. Germanyalways ran a trade surplus. That is the most basic measure of a country's competitiveness: foreigners are buyingits goods. Germany's unemployment rate in 2.000 ayeravd 7.5_percept not hugely different than its current 7.0percent rate.The story here is that Friedman seems to have completely missed the basics of the current economic crisis inspite of his weeks of conversing with senior economic policy makers. The current crisis is due to a lack ofdemand pure and simple. If we generate demand either through more expansionary Fed monetary policygreater fiscal stimulus or increased exports due to a falling dollar there is no reason to believe that theeconomy will not return to high levels of employment. Certainly Friedman has presented no evidence thatincreased demand will not generate increased employment as it always has.The longer term debt problem is overwhelmingly a health care story. Apparently Mr. Friedman's sources don'thave access to documents like the Medicare trustees report which imply that U.S. health care costs will becontrolled and there will be no serious long-term deficit problem. This may prove -Wrong but it seems that itwould have at least been worth noting in his column. Of course if we have not fixed our health care systemwe can always achieve huge saving by retyinq on the more efficient health care systems in other countries.If Friedman's intention was to scare us he succeeded. After all if senior economic policy makers in the U.S.and Germany are as badly misinformed as Friedman implies then we can expect some very had times ahead."

"Dear, By way of introduction I am Mr.Idris Umar working in the credit and accounts department Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, Lagos, Nigeria. I write you in respect of a foreign customer with Domiciliary A/C number 6402356789. His name is Engineer Joseph Schultzman. He was among those who died in a plane crash here in Nigeria during the reign of late General Sani Abacha. Since the demise of this our customer, Engineer Joseph Schultzman, who was an oil merchant/contractor, I have kept a close watch of the deposit records and accounts and since then no body has come to claim the money in this a/c as next of kin to the late Engineer. He had only $38.5mllion in his a/c and the a/c is coded. It is only an insider that could produce the code or password of the deposit particulars. As it stands now, there is nobody in that position to produce the needed information other than my very self considering my position in the bank. Based on the reason that nobody has come forward to claim the deposit as next of kin, I hereby ask for your co operation in using your name as the next of kin to the deceased to send these funds out to a foreign offshore bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself and you. At this point I am the only one with the information because I have removed the deposit file from the safe . By this doing, what is required of you is to send an application laying claims of the deposit as next of kin to the late Engineer. I will need your full name and address, company or residential, so that i can computerize them to tally with next of kin column in the certificate of deposit. Finally I want you to understand that the request for a foreigner as the next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and for that reason alone a local cannot represent as next of kin. When you contact me, then we shall discuss on how the money will be split between us. Trusting to hear from you, I remain Respectfully yours, Mr. Idris Umar.

She's sorta right. We post as much video as we can and bat 1.000 on domestic events. Tougher on overseas eventssince we don't have the resources abroad with us that we have here at home. We held a meeting with the web &broadcasting folks today to talk about this and came up with a few ways to bolster our road video.But generally speaking it's a huge priority for us all to post video whenever possible.
"FROM:Mr.Peter WongHang Seng Bank Ltd17 Des Voeux RoadHq Branch.Hong Kong.This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignoreit as unserious could come into your mind; but please consider it adivine wish and accept it with a deep sense of humility. I am Mr. PeterWong director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have a obscuredbusiness suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Basem who was withthe Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five HundredThousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity severalnotices was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Againafter the war another notification was sent and still no response came fromhim. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killedduring the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Major FadiBasem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including thepaper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the lasttime he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in mybank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United StateDollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claimit. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of mycountry at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownershipof the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you asa foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that youwill be able to receive his funds.WHAT IS TO BE DONE:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that weshall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will preparethe necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin toMajor Fadi Basem , all that is required from you at this stage is for youto provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney cancommence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, theattorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessaryapproval and letter of probate in your favour for the move of the fundsto an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopta legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessarydocuments. Please endeavour to observe utmost discretion in all mattersconcerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account weshall share in the ratio of 60% for me, 40% for you .

"Khan Anwaar Fharaad  5ï¿½me Av. X Bd Tï¿½li Diallo,   Quartier Sandervallia, Commune de Kaloum,   BP 5331, Conakry, Guinea.     Your attention please:  I am Barrister Khan Anwaar Faraad a Guinean Solicitor & Financial Attorney. I was the personal attorney to a client who was an expatriate mining consultant/contractor with Guinean Petroleum Corporation in Conakry , Guinea . The contractor here-in-after referred as my client was also a Diamond/Gold Merchant.     He made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit of Twenty five million United States of America Dollars in one of the prime banks here in the state capital of with standing statement/agreement with the bank that all correspondences in respect to the fixed deposit contract must be sent to him through my humble chambers. Upon maturity, the routine notification was forwarded to me that I dispatched to his forwarding address as usual without a reply. After a month, I sent a reminder which I received from the bank without any reply again. Finally, I discovered from my Client's contract employers- Guinean Petroleum Corporation that he died among many others in an auto crash along Labï¿½ express road. On further investigations, I found out that he died without making any WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I also discovered that he did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his fixed deposit contract with the bank in Conakry Guinea .     First, I am contacting you based on the official letter I just received from his bankers reminding me that Guinean law states that at the expiration of 5(five) years the money will revert to the ownership of the Guinean Government if I do not confirm the next of kin to claim the fund.      Secondly, as a foreigner, to stand in as the next of kin to him so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not go into the hands of some corrupt government officials. Note that this transaction is simple and risk free because I will provide expert legal services that will guarantee the successful execution of this deal.   I wish to point out that after the claims, I would want 20% of this money to be shared among charity organizations, while the remaining 80% is shared equally between us. Most importantly, I would also require your assistance towards investing my share in your country or anywhere as you may advice. If you are interested, please contact me immediately. Upon your response, I shall provide you with more details and how we shall proceed with the claims. I expect you to observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be profitable for both of us.     I strongly believe every information is given for you to access my status before any further interactions.     I go on anticipating your urgent co-operation.     Thanks & Regards  Barr. Khan A.

"This is the distilled pure and utterly conventional wisdom of much of the DC political chattering class at this moment. Thefirst two paragraphs are the most important completely accurate in assessment the rest twaddle:1:1Monday Oct. 112010Why Obama Is Losing the Political WarBy Mark HalperinBarack Obama is being politically crushed in a vise. From above by elite opinion about his competence. From below bymass anger and anxiety over unemployment. And it is too late for him to do anything about this predicament until afterNovember's elections.With the exception of core Obama Administration loyalists most politically engaged elites have reached the sameconclusions: the White House is in over its head isolated insular arrogant and clueless about how to get along with orpersuade members of Congress the media the business community or working-class voters. This view is held by FoxNews pundits executives and anchors at the major old-media outlets reporters who cover the White House Democraticand Republican congressional leaders and governors many Democratic business people and lawyers who raised bigmoney for Obama in 2008 and even some members of the Administration just beyond the inner circle. (See Obama'stroubled first year issue by issue.)On Friday after the release of the latest bleak unemployment data â the last major jobs figures before the midterms âObama said ""Putting the American people back to work expanding opportunity rebuilding the economic security of themiddle class is the moral and national challenge of our time."" But elites feel the President has failed to meet that challengeand are convinced he will be unable to do so in the remainder of his term. Moreover there is a growing perception thatObama's decisions are causing harm â that businesses are being hurt by the Administration's legislation and thateconomic recovery is stalling because of the uncertainty surrounding energy policy health care deficits housingimmigration and spending.And that sentiment is spreading. Many members of the general public appear deeply skeptical of Obama's capacity to turnthings around especially but not exclusively those inclined to dislike him â Tea Partyers and John McCain voters butalso tens of millions of middle-class Americans including quite a few who turned out for Obama in 2008. (See how someAmericans are facing the prospect of long-term unemployment.)The misery afflicting the country has no political affiliation. Listen to the voices from this striking TV ad for Rob Portmanthe Republican former Congressman and Bush budget director who is running for Senate from Ohio. One woman at aDayton career fair says starkly ""There are no jobs."" A man announces plaintively and with obvious frustration ""I've beenlooking for a job now for 13 months."" Events like this job fair are becoming the grim iconic gatherings of our time thebreadlines for the Obama years.Most of Obama's private (and sometimes public) rebuttals to the voices slamming him on all sides are justified or spot on.He did inherit a lot of problems from the Bush Administration. He did act quickly in the initial weeks of his Administration tostave off a worldwide depression. His efforts at job creation have been obstructed by Republicans (even the proposalsbased on policies supported by the GOP in the past). His opponents haven't put forth specifics of their own nor offeredgenuine compromise while the media have allowed the right's activists and gabbers to run wild with criticism withoutfurnishing legitimate alternative solutions. (See Barack Obama's top 10 sound bites.)But Obama has exacerbated his political problems not just by failing to enact policies that would have actually turned theeconomy around but also by authorizing a series of tactical moves intended to demonize Republicans and distract fromthe problems at hand. He has wasted time lambasting his foes when he should have been putting forth his agenda in aclear optimistic fashion defending the benefits of his key decisions during the past two years (health care and theTroubled Asset Relief Program for example) and explaining what he would do with a re-elected Democratic majority tospur growth.Throughout the year we have been treated to Obama-led attacks on George W. Bush and Dick Cheney Rush LimbaughCongressman Joe Barton (for his odd apology to BP) John Boehner (for seeking the speakership â or was it somethingabout an ant?) and Fox News (for everything). Suitable Democratic targets in some cases perhaps but not worth the timeof a busy Commander in Chief. In the past few days we have witnessed the spectacle of the President himself and histop advisers wading into allegations that Republicans are attempting to buy the election using foreign money launderedthrough the Chamber of Commerce combining with Karl Rove and his wealthy backers to fund a flood of negativetelevision commercials. Not only is this issue convoluted and far-fetched but it also distracts from the issues voters careabout frustrating political insiders and alienating struggling citizens (not that many are following such an offbeat storyline). Feinting and gibing can't obscure those job numbers. (See the best viral campaign ads of 2010.)The President and Democrats have passed many significant measures (the stimulus spending the auto-company rescuethe health care law and the financial regulation effort) that someday may be seen as brave and bold the foundation for abetter economy. Obama and his closest aides certainly think that will happen. But the President was correct when he saidFriday ""the only piece of economic news that folks still looking for work want to hear is 'You're hired"" and that's still notoccurring for too many Americans.The politically good news for Obama is that no matter what the outcome of the midterm elections everything changes inJanuary. Republicans will have a greater obligation politically and morally to help govern rather than thwart and badger.The President will get a chance in his State of the Union address and in his budget proposal to show he is turning thepage on the political horrors of 2010 for his party and the nation. But before then Republicans are almost certainly goingto demonstrate that you can beat something with nothing especially when Americans seem to think that the ObamaAdministration hasn't much to offer either except more of the same that isn't working.â¢ Find this article at:â¢ http://www.time.com/time/golitics/article/08599202471800.htmlCopyright Â© 2010 Time Inc.

GelbA diplomat under fire.With the presidential campaign drowning in boredom commentators were desperatelysearching for news preferably a new victim to brighten their days. And along came SusanRice. A couple Sundays ago the U.N. ambassador made the mistake of appearing on the talkshows to insist that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi Libya was ""spontaneous""rather than a terrorist plot. You would have thought she had said that the pope was aMormon.Out came the Washington daggers. She lied. She was a shill. Benghazi was no spontaneousevent. It was the work of an al Qaeda offshoot. The White House had fumbled keyintelligence information and was now trying to cover up its unforgivable mistake. Rice wasjust covering up for the president. Her reward would be Obama's nominating her to succeedHillary Clinton as secretary of State.The commentariat immediately rolled out plans to nail Rice and the Obama team to thewall. Peter King the Grand Inquisitor of the Republicans in the House of Representativespledged to ""investigate"" and hold hearings. And that said the commentariat would be theend of Rice's hopes to become the new Hillary.U.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739637Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.Now let's take an unfashionable step back and examine the facts such as they are. Rice didnot make up the ""spontaneous"" story or have it handed to her by White House conspirators.She got it from the same daily intelligence brief given to the president. Those daily intelreports told the very story Rice repeated publicly i.e. that the Benghazi mob formed moreor less on its own mainly in reaction to the American video cartooning sacred Muslimfigures and that extremists then took advantage to kill including Ambassador ChristopherStevens. Rice didn't make up that story. The problem was not with Rice; it was with theinevitably complicated U.S. intelligence process.Her mistake was taking the initial intelligence at face value. The White House biiefers madethe same error and so did I. I too repeated in an op-ed on The Daily Beast what theintelligence briefers told me but I knew very well that more and contradictory informationwould appear soon enough. It always does.Sure the CIA had additional intel from the start but it hadn't begun to sift through all thecommunications intercepts satellite photos and human reports. It always takes time to sortout facts from fictions and find consistent threads. Seemingly this gossamer information isnow taking shape.Meantime Rice is still very much in the running for the job at Fogg' Bottom along withSenator John Kerry NSC Adviser Tom Donilon and former diplomat Nicholas Burns nowof Harvard. She was Obama's earliest loyalist in the foreign-policy crowd and he still likesher despite lackluster reports on her performance at the U.N. The smears though flatlyinaccurate won't help her either. What will help her and more importantly a flaggingObama after the first debate is hunting down the Benghazi culprits.U.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739637Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

I write you this proposal in good =faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to =reveal to you.I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On =November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON =PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 =calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred =Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer =before I was moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003, as =his account officer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him =on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding =address but the letter was returned undelivered. After sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was again returned =and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum =Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand =of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his =country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On further investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser=92s family wife and =two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not =declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, including =his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any WILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under =dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard =from the owner since 2003.

By =end of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which =will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above =$5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not for =terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country =immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the =money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source =of the money. I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and =that is why I am contacting you for an assistance.

Happy Birthday! An early QDDR return. AM
We're getting ready to get a lot of these â I think not b/c it defeats the purpose of having A/S and others meet and getto know each other.
"     With due respect, trust and humanity, I write to you this proposal which I believe would be of great interest to you. I am Mrs Awa Keita, the wife of late EL-MUSTAPHA KEITA of blessed memory. Before my husband was killed by forces loyal to MAJOR JOHNNY PAUL KOROMA, he was the Director-General of Gold and Diamond Mining Corporation (GDMC) of Sierra-Leone.     My husband targeted by the rebel forces in the course of the revolution. Two days before his death, he managed to sneak a written message to us, explaining his condition and concerning one trunk box of valuables containing money and gold, which he deposited with a private Security & Finance Company in Abidjan Cote d'Iviore.     He instructed me to take our two children(Ibrahim and Zinat) and move out of Sierra-Leone immediately to Abidjan Cote d'Iviore before the Peace Keeping Forces of the Economic Community of West African States(ECOMOG) monitoring team intervened to arrest the situation of mass killings by the rebels, which was the order of the day.      Eventually it resulted into full war. I became a widow overnight; helpless situation without partner. At that moment of calamity, every person was running for his/her life. In the content of the deed he signed with the Security Company, he used the name of his son Master Ibrahim Keita as the next of kin. The real content of the box were not disclosed to the Security Company due to security reasons. Now as a refugee, we have very limited financial rights here, we intend to leave this country immediately with the whole money for investment in your country because of the stable situation and mostly for the future benefits of my children.      We have since applied for political asylum. The cash involved inside in the box is US$ 10.5 Million ( Ten million and five hundred thousand united state dollars). I want you to assist us to claim the box from the Security Company as the new beneficiary so that the change ownership of the documents covering this consignment/box will be legally effected to your name as to enable you have this money deposited in a local account here in Abidjan in your name for the easier transfer of this money in to your oversaes bank account.      We also source for good investment so that we can invest the money wisely. We have in mind to establish a rewarding investment and good relationship with you. Concerning the money, we are prepared to offer you a reasonable percentage of 20% of the total sum proceeds. Meanwhile 5% has been mapped out for any expenses you may incurred in the course of this transaction and 75% will be for my family.     For the interest of this business, do not hesitate to contact us with the above email addresss immediately you receive this message for more information to enable us proceed in earnest towards concluding all our arrangements.      No other person knows about this money apart from my children and I. We await your most urgent response.      Thanks for your co-operation and God bless you.     Best regards,    Madam Keita.		--------------------------------- Yahoo! Mail Use Photomail to share photos without annoying attachments."
"Dear friend,  31-612-696-672I am Domas k, yankThe son of former minister of finance (Domas Makabo) of the Republic of Sierra-Leone West Africa based on the information I gathered from your chamber of commerce and industry on your credibility, I decide to contact for the assistance.Regarding my zeal toward foreign investment and security for my life and possession, I therefore write to you a break down of this proposal.My father died when a group of rebel soldier led by Sir Foday Sankohoverthrown Government of sierra-Leone forcing the president out of power and killing many members of the cabinet and minister including my own father. When it become apparently obvious that the country no longer safe for the citizens due to the political war and massive killing and destruction of properties, I decided to move to Holland with a treasure containing the sum of US$12.500.000.00(twelve million five hundred thousand united state dollars) through a diplomatic means, this fund is the last tangible money my father left behind before his death.The said amount is presently in Holland (The Netherlands) where I amcurrently seeking political asylum. While the consignment containing the fund is in the custody of the diplomatic courier company they are not aware of the content as it was deposited as personal effect and artifact. I am seeking for partner who will serve as a the guardian of this fund with whom I could plan the best way to move this money out of Holland for investment which is my main purpose of contacting you.Thus I decided to offer you 20% of the total money for assisting me toactualize this project while 10% of the money has been set aside to offset any incidental expenses that might incurred during the course of this funds and the balance 70%shall be for me and my family which shall be invested in your country. And are will visit you country soonest in order to inquire areas of possible business investment. I shall be sincerely glad if my request is rendered.Thank youGod bless youDomas k. yank"
"sbwhoeopFriday December 3 2010 9:55 AMH: Roger Cohen in NYT: ""American Diplomacy Revealed â as Good""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/opinion/03iht-edcohen.html?hpDecember 2 2010American Diplomacy Revealed as GoodBy ROGER COHENNEW YORK â Let's hear it for the men and women of the U.S. Foreign Service!They are to judge from the WikiLeaks dump of a quarter-million of their private or secret cables thoughtful well-informedand dedicated servants of the American interest who write clear declarative English sentences.I've not heard much in the torrent of Wiki-chatter about these admirable career diplomats whose diplomacy is nowcondemned to be unquiet. Yet it is they whose lives have been upturned. Every journalist knows that if theircorrespondence over several years was suddenly made public they would lose most of their sources. That should giveevery journalist pause.So it will be on the front line of U.S. diplomacy. Contacts will self-censor. They will go quiet particularly in the moreconspiratorial parts of the world which also tend to be the most unstable like the Middle East. Layers of secrecy will beadded.Julian Assange the thin-skinned founder of WikiLeaks has hurt U.S. interests across a broad but probably shallowspectrum. That will satisfy him in that he's a self-styled foe of the United States. The guy makes me queasy.Perhaps the most shocking thing about the Assange treasure trove â beyond the ""shock"" of venal Gulf Arab Sunnileaders looking for war on the cheap against Shiite Iran so long as it doesn't disrupt their U.S.-armed fiefdoms; or the""shock"" of Pakistani double-dealing and nuclear procrastination; or the ""shock"" of yet more premature Israeli predictionson when Iran will have a nuclear weapon; or the ""shock"" of continued Saudi funding of Al Qaeda; or the ""shock"" of theChinese Politburo hacking into Google; or the ""shock"" of Muammar el-Qaddafi's taste for voluptuous Slavic women andSilvio Berlusconi's taste for all women â perhaps the biggest shock of all is just how professional sober and short onembarrassment all these cables are and just how much they conform with the world as we already knew it right down tothe familiar adjectives evoking French President Nicolas Sarkozy: ""hyperactive"" ""mercurial"" ""authoritarian"" ""erratic""""monarch-like.""I swear if they hadn't become diplomats a lot of these State Department people could have become good hacks.Overall my longstanding admiration for America's conscientious diplomats has been redoubled not least for thisunderreported nugget on the turbulent Iranian election of 2009 contained in a cable of Jan. 12 2010 from Dubai: ""Whilewe don't know nor might not ever know the real June 12 vote count it is clear that the turnout was at record high levelsand that there was systematic vote count fraud (if in fact the votes were even counted) to ensure that Ahmadinejad 'wonbig' in the first round.""It is good to know that this is the innermost conviction of American diplomacy: the fraud was evident to anyone in Tehranduring the election and its violent aftermath.A couple more observations on Iran: The first is that the Sunni autocrats of the Gulf are as exercised as they are aboutTehran in part because they know that any U.S.-Iranian breakthrough might make them more dispensable to the UnitedStates. Their vested interest in the prevailing Middle Eastern strategic equation is strong; nothing would redraw the MiddleEast more than overcoming the U.S.-Iranian psychosis.The second is that President Barack Obama's approach to Iran has been much more conventional than his initial outreachsuggested. Old habits of attempted coercion trumped originality. Very quickly he fell back on Dennis Ross's tired thinkingabout balancing ""appetizing carrots"" with ""sharp sticks"" in tackling Iran's nuclear program.The cables reveal that as early as March 2009 a senior U.S. diplomat was talking ""dual track"" telling Europeans that""engagement alone is unlikely to succeed"" and calling for added ""pressure."" Perhaps Iranian skepticism could never havebeen overcome; certainly this approach guaranteed longstanding Iranian grievances would fester.Assange himself clearly understands nothing of Iran or the Middle East or diplomacy. In an interview with Time heexpressed approval for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""coming out with a very interesting statement thatleaders should speak in public like they do in private whenever they can"" and bought into Netanyahu's view that this inAssange's words would ""lead to some kind of increase in the peace process in the Middle East and particularly in relationto Iran.ItHuh? Netanyahu was referring to Arab leaders' now-documented private calls for a U.S.-led war against Iran an option healso favors. And that for Assange is a step forward to peace! He's all over the place.What should we make of this brainy naÃ¯f who told my colleague John Burns that America is a threat to democracy? He's aloose canon; let him be. My impression is he's self-armed with a spade and he's digging.And what of the messenger's message? The cables are intriguing offering plenty of voyeuristic titillation but no gasp ofdiscovery. They provide texture but break little new ground. Yet their publication has done significant damage to thecourageous work of America's diplomats and may endanger lives. That's a tradeoff that I find troubling and unpersuasive."

In thinking about the Kissinger interview the only issue I think that might be raised is that I see POTUS at least once aweek while K saw Nixon everyday. Of course if I were dealing w that POTUS I'd probably camp in his office to preventhim from doing something problematic. Do you see this as a problem?

I know this is a very difficult time for everyoneat the Mission and our thoughts are with all of you.I had a good conversation with Jim Williams about the strategic communications initiative and I wanted to bring you upto speed on our thinking and where things stand with Keith.Based on our discussions and the excellent paper that Jim prepared I think there are several critical areas that we needto address:â¢ Work with our counterparts in the Mexican government to help them develop their capacity to handle thecommunications aspects of the drug initiative more effectivelyâ¢ Develop a process for ensuring the GOM and USG have clear coordinated and consistent messaging on allaspects of the initiativeâ¢ Increase public awareness in Mexico about ""Merida"" ; based on a report I got from INR last week there is verylittle awareness or understanding of the program in Mexico and the contributions of USGâ¢ Work with GOM to develop an on-going and effective communications strategy at all levels to provide peopleacross the country with information that is directly relevant to them and which they need to navigate their waythrough this crisis. For example what is going on in their community; what are local authorities doing; whatprograms are available in their schools; what can they do etc. I have increasingly come to believe that the lackof this sort of ""personally relevant"" information at a time of crisis increases public anxiety and contributes to theoverall sense of things being out of control. We have begun to focus on this issue and have worked both in Haitiand last year in Pakistan to provide people with a steady stream of information they can use. We are using awide array of communications tools to deliver these messages that allows the information to be delivered in avery granular local personal way. The other benefit of this approach is that it helps balance the steady streamof gruesome news being put out by traditional media.â¢ Work with private sector in both Mexico and US to develop broad based PSA campaign to increase awareness ofthe initiative and maintain public support for the effortâ¢ Increase awareness in Mexico of USG efforts to combat drug use in USKeith has reached out to a number of his associates at BDA and unfortunately he has met with some resistance to BDAtaking this project on. The personal safety issue seems to be the biggest concern. I do believe we will be able toovercome this to some degree and I have some ideas which we can discuss when we next speak. In the meantime I havereached out to Pat Mitchell of the Paley Center and she believes she will be able to help engage the US private sectoronce we have a plan of action in place.Finally with regard to next week's trip by S Jim feels it might be better for me to come to Mexico sometime in late Aprilrather than have it as part of next week's agenda. I am happy to do whatever works best for you. Keith is also preparedto come next week or in April. Just let us know.Judth"
"H: In case you haven't seen it this is the fully articulated view of the Netanyahu government and Likud about ""the crisis.""-ihe New Republic is a preferred cutlet for the highest level Likudineocon propaganda. ?Viichae! Oren a channel for IsraeliIntel was a frequent contributor in the past. On a lower level; so was Michael Ledeen when he was traffickingdisinformation. The New Republic was critical in undermining Carter when he pressed Begin Israeli intel used Ledeenand TNR to put out the stories on Billy Carter. But TNR is only one key being hit in the Wurlitzer. Here's one small butfrank thing: Axelrod should not be a foreign policy spokesman on any issue or area. He has badly exacerbated this one.Many people in the press feel he's out of his lane and resent being lectured by him on foreq..3n policy. Foreign Policymagazine website has run a piece on this reflecting widespread sentiment. (I've enclosed this article bellow the TNR onebelow.) I'd make Steinberg tell Donilon they need to rein in Axelrod. Axelrod has enough to do fixing the domestic messeshe's made. Let it come from Steinberg. He's unhappy anyway. Sidhttp://www.tnr.corniarticie/world/the-crisis?page=00EaPublished on The New RepublicWas Obama's confrontation with Israel premeditated'?Yossi Klein Halevi4. March 16 2010 17:13 pmJERUSALEMâSuddenly my city feels again like a war zone..Since the suicide bombings ended in 2005 life inJerusalem has been for the most part relatively calm. The worst disruptions have been the traffic jams resulting fromconstruction of a light rail. jUst like in a normal city. But navy again there are clusters of helmeted border nOtiCe near thegates of the Old City. black smoke from burning tires in the Arab village across from my porch young men marching withgreen Islamist flags toward my neighborhood ambulances parked at strategic places ready for this city's ultimatenightmare.The return of menace to Jerusalem is not because a mid-level bureaucrat announced stage four of a seven-stage processin the eventual construction oft600 apartments in Ramat Shiomo. a Jewish neighborhood in northeast Jerusalem. Suchannouncements and building projects have become so routine over the years that Paestinians have scarcely respondedlet alone violently. In negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis the permanence of Ramat Shiomo and other Jewishneighborhoods in East Jerusalem has been a given. Ramat Shlomo located between the Jewish neighborhoods ofFrench Hill and Rarrot will remain within the boundaries of Israeli Jerusalem accord ng to every peace plan. Unlike theSnail Jewish enclaves inserted into Arab neighbochoocis on which Israelis are strongly buliding in the establishedJewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem defines the national consensus.Why then the outbreak of violence now? Why Harness ""day of rage"" over Jerusalem and the Palestinian Authority's callto gather on the Temple Mount to ""save"" the Dome of the Rock from non-existent plans to build the Third Temple? Whythe sudden outrage over rebuilding a synagogue destroyed by the Jordanians in 1948 in the Old City's Jewish Quarterwhen dozens of synagogues and yeshivas have been built in the quarter without incident?The answer lies not in Jerusalem but in Washington. By placing the issue of building in Jewish neighborhoods in EastJerusalem at the center of the peace process President Obama has inadvertently challenged the Palestinians to do noless.Astonishingly. Obama is repeating the key tactical mistake of his failed efforts to restart Middle East peace talks over thelast year. Though Oben-la's insistence on a settlement freeze to help restart negotiations was legitimate he went a steptoo far by including building in East Jerusalem. Every Israeli government over the last four decades has built in the Jewishneighborhoods of East Jerusalem; no government let alone one headed by the Likud could possibly agree to a freezethere. Obama made resumption of negotiations hostage to a demand that could not be met. The result was thatPalestinian leaders were forced to adjust their demands accordingly.Obama is directly responsible for one of the most absurd turns in the history of Middle East negotiations. ThoughPalestinian leaders negotiated with Israeli governments that built extensively in the West Bank they now refused to sitdown with the first Israeli government to actually agree to a suspension of building. Obama's demand for a building freezein Jerusalem led to a freeze in negotiations.Finally after intensive efforts the administration produced the pathetic achievement of ""proximity talks""âsettingPalestinian-Israeli negotiations back a generation to the time when Palestinian leaders refused to sit at the same tablewith Israelis.That Obama could be guilty of such amateurishness was perhaps forgivable because he was after ail an amateur. Buthe has now taken his failed policy and intensified it. By demanding that Israel stop building in Ramat Shlomo andelsewhere in East Jerusalemâand placing that demand at the center of American-Israeli relationsâhe's ensured that thePalestinians won't show up even to proximity talks. This is no longer amateurishness; it is pique disguised as policy.Initially when the announcement about building in Ramat Shlomo was made Israelis shared Vice President Biden'shumiliation and were outraged at their government's incompetence. The widespread sense here was that Netanyahudeserved the administration's condemnation not because of what he did but because of what he didn't do: He failed toconvey to all parts of his government the need for caution during Biden's visit symptomatic of his chaotic style ofgoverning generally.But not even the opposition accused Netanyahu of a deliberate provocation. These are not the days of Yitzhak Shamirthe former Israeli prime minister who used to greet a visit from Secretary of State James Baker with an announcement ofthe creation of another West Bank settlement. Netanyahu has placed the need for strategic cooperation with the U.S. onthe Iranian threat ahead of the right-wing political agenda. That's why he included the Labor Party into his coalition andwhy he accepted a two-state solutionâan historic achievement that set the Likud however reluctantly within themainstream consensus supporting Palestinian statehood. The last thing Netanyahu wanted was to embarrass Bidenduring his goodwill visit and trigger a clash with Obama over an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood.Nor is it likely that there was a deliberate provocation from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party which runs the interior ministrythat oversees building procedures. Shas which supports peace talks and territorial compromise is not a nationalist party.Its interest is providing housing for its constituents like the future residents of Ramat Shlomo; provoking internationalincidents is not its style.Finally the very ordinariness of the building procedureâthe fact that construction in Jewish East Jerusalem is consideredby Israelis routineâis perhaps the best proof that there was no intentional ambush of Biden. Apparently no one in theinterior ministry could imagine that a long-term plan over Ramat Shiomo would sabotage a state visit.In turning an incident into a crisis Obama has convinced many Israelis that he was merely seeking a pretext to pick a fightwith Israel. Netanyahu was inadvertently shabby; Obama deliberately so.Ac.tcording to a banner headline in the newspaper Ma'ariv senior Likud officials believe that Obama's goal is to topple theNetanyahu government by encouraging those in the Labor Party who want to quit the coalition.The popular assumption is that Obama is seeking to prove his resolve as a leader by getting tough with Israel. Given hisineffectiveness against Iran and his tendency to violate his own self-imposed deadlines for sanctions the Israeli public isnot likely to be impressed. Indeed Israelis' initial anger at Netanyahu has turned to anger against Obama. According to anIsrael Radio poll on March 16 62 percent of Israelis blame the Obama administration for the crisis while 20 percentblame Netanyahu. (Another 17 percent blame Shas leader Eli Yishai.) â¢In the last year the administration has not once publicly condemned the Palestinians for lack of good faithâeven thoughthe Palestinian Authority media has for example been waging a months-long campaign denying the Jews' historic rootsin Jerusalem. Just after Biden left Ramailah Palestinian officials held a ceremony naming a square in the city after aterrorist responsible for the massacre of 38 Israeli civilians. That too didn't merit an administration rebuke.Obama's one-sided public pressure against Israel could intensify the atmosphere of ""open season"" against Israelinternationally. Indeed the European Union has reaffirmed it is linking improved economic relations with Israel to theresumption of the peace processâas if it's Israel rather than the Palestinians that has refused to come to the table.If the administration's main tactical error in Middle East negotiating was emphasizing building in Jerusalem its mainstrategic error was assuming that a two-state solution was within easy reach. Shortly after Obama took office RehmEmanuel vvas quoted in the Israeli press insisting that a Palestinian state would be created within Obama's first tent.instead a year later we are in the era of suspended proximity talks. Now the administration is demanding that Israelnegotiate over final status issues in proximity talks as a way of convincing the Palestinians to agree to those talks--as ifIsraelis would agree to discuss the future of Jerusalem when Palestinian leaders refuse to even sit with them.To insist on the imminent possibility of a two-state solution requires amnesia. Biden's plea to Israelis to consider awithdrawal to an approximation of the 1967 borders in exchange for peace ignored the fact that Israel made that offertwice in the last decade: first when Prime Minister Ehud Barak accepted the Clinton Proposals of December 2000 andthen more recently when Prime Minister Ehud Olmert renewed the offer to Mahrnoud Abbas. Abbas says Olmert neverreplied.The reason for Palestinian rejection of a two-state solution is because a deal would require Palestinians to confine thereturn of the descendants of the 1948 refugees to Palestine rather than to Israel. That would prevent a two-state solutionfrom devolving into a bi-national one-state solution. Israel's insistence on survival remains the obstacle to peace.To achieve eventual peace the international community needs to pressure Palestinian leaders to forgo their claim to Haifaand Jaffa and confine their people's right of return to a future Palestinian state--just as the Jews will need to forgo theirclaim to Hebron and Bethlehem and confine their people's right of return to the state of Israel. That is the only possibledeal: conceding my right of return to Greater Israel in exchange for your right of return to Greater Palestine. A majority ofIsraelisâalong with the political systemâhas accepted that principle. On the Palestinian side the political system hasrejected it.In the absence of Palestinian willingness to compromise on the right of return negotiations should not focus on a two-state solution but on more limited goals.There have been positive signs of change on the Palestinian side in the last few years. The rise of Hamas has createdpanic within Fatah and the result is for the first time genuine security cooperation with Israel. Also the emergence ofSalem Fayyad as Palestinian prime minister marks a shift from ideological to pragmatic leadership (though Fayyad stilllacks a power base). Finally the West Bank economy is growing thanks in part to Israel's removal of dozens ofroadblocks. The goal of negotiations at this point in the conflict should be to encourage those trends.But by focusing on building in Jerusalem Obama has undermined that possibility too. To the fictitious notion of a peaceprocess Obama has now added the fiction of an intransigent Israel blocking the peace process.The administration according to a report in the Israeli ne\Aispaper Yedito Aharonot is making an even more insidiousaccusation against Israel. During his visit wrote Yediot Aharanot Bicien told Israeli leaders that their policies areendangering American lives in Afghanistan and Iraq. The report has been denied in the White House. Whether or not theremark was made what is clear today in Jerusalem is that Obama's recklessness is endangering Israeli--and Palestinian--lives. As I listen to police sirens outside my window Obama's political Intifada against Netanyahu seems to be turning intoa third intifada over Jerusalem.Yossi Klein Ha/evils a senior fellow of the She/em Center in Jerusalem and a contributing editor of The New Republic.WM David Axelrod please be quiet pease?Posted By 4 'â  (I?

Still couldn't the administration have sent Hillary Clinton toone of the Sunday morning talk shows instead? Wouldn't she have been the more appropriate spokesman.I've spent enought time inside the Beltway to be leery of the gossipy tidbits I collect when I'm down there. That said therewas one persistent drumbeat I heard during my last sojourn -- that Axelrod and the politicai advisors were acting asObama's foreign policy gatekeepers.Now I am shocked shocked that cciiiticialv. :hirkinc aciout foreimi oa!icv :n manner.

IN FACT I COULD HAVE DONE THIS DEAL ALONE BUT BECAUSE OF MY POSITION IN THIS COUNTRY AS A CIVIL SERVANT(A BANKER),WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OPERATE A FOREIGN ACCOUNT AND WOULD EVENTUALLY RAISE AN EYE BROW ON MY SIDE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER BECAUSE I WORK IN THIS BANK. THIS IS THE ACTUAL REASON WHY IT WILL REQUIRE A SECOND PARTY OR FELLOW WHO WILL FORWARD CLAIMS AS THE NEXT OF KIN WITH AFFIDAVIT OF TRUST OF OATH TO THE BANK AND ALSO PRESENT A FOREIGN ACCOUNT WHERE HE WILL NEED THE MONEY TO BE RE-TRANSFERRED INTO ON HIS REQUEST AS IT MAY BE AFTER DUE VERIFICATION AND CLARIFICATION BY THE CORRESPONDENT BRANCH OF THE BANK WHERE THE WHOLE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED FROM TO YOUR OWN DESIGNATION BANK ACCOUNT. I WILL NOT FAIL TO INFORM YOU THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE.ON SMOOTH CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION, YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO 30% OF THE TOTAL SUM AS GRATIFICATION, WHILE 5% WILL BE SET ASIDE TO TAKE CARE OF EXPENSES THAT MAY ARISE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER AND ALSO TELEPHONE BILLS, WHILE 65% WILL BE FOR ME AND MY PARTNERS.

There are a number of different possibilities for how the decision on the Guinea/Madagascar credentials may gotomorrow. (It is Zambia and Tanzania bringing the challenge on behalf of the AU.) I was under the impression that wewould not have to vote on the potential credentials challenges. We may have to.We may have to vote on a motion to *deny* them credentials and exclude them. For the moment the guidance is tovote to credential all countries â including these two â as is customary while conducting outreach with TanzaniaZambia and the AU to exnlain that WP have our own imnpratives hut ma cunnnrt thp fart that they are taking aprincipled stand.We may have to vote on a motion to *defer* decision which would allow them to be seated and vote but would notformally grant credentials. For the moment the guidance is to potentially support such a motion â this was the practicewith respect to South Africa between 1983 and 1994. Everyone is in the same place on this.Ultimately however the whole thing may die of its own weight. This is probably the most likely outcome.

"As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry forme, because, I believe everyone will die someday.My name is MRS WU YUNG a merchant SENTOSA in SINDAPORE,I have been diagnosed with Esophagealcancer.It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right nowI have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. Ihave not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared foranyone(not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was nevergenerous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on mybusiness as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as Inow know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make allthe money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance tocome to this  world I would live my life a different way from how Ihave lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given mostof my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members aswell as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me andaccept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, asI want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, Ihave distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeriaand Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of myaccounts and distribute the money which I have there to charityorganization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money tothemselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to becontended with whatI have left for them.The last of my money which no one knows of is the hugecash deposit of  eighteen million united states dollars that I havewith a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collectthis deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.I have set aside twenty percent for you and for yourtime.God be with you.regardsMRS WU YUNG"
"ATTN:DIRECTOR/C .E. OWith due respect trust and humility, I write you this proposal, which I believe will be a great interest to you. I found your contact while I was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist my family and I. That's why I contacted you.I am Prince Charles Zuma the first son of Late Mr.Morris Zuma who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I found your contact while I was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist my family in a business transaction, hence I decided to write to you.Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to Deposit the sum of US$29 M (Twenty Nine Million United States Dollars). in a private security company, as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as Precious Metals to avoid any suspicion from the security company.This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals and establishment of a new Commercial farm in Swaziland. This land problem came up when Zimbabwe President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a New Land Act reform, which wholly affected the rich white Commercial farmers and some few Black Commercial farmers.This resulted to killings and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans in the society. In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for which my father is a victim. It is against this background that my family and I who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's money to a foreign Country since the law of South Africa prohibits refugees to transact any business with the bank.As the eldest son of my father, I am given the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign partner who will provide a foreign account where this money could be transferred into as soon as possible for the investment of my family. I must also let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free. If you accept to assist my family and me. All I want from you is for you to make arrangements and come to Johannesburg,South Africa so that you can open a non-resident account in your name which will aid us in transferring this money into any account you will nominate overseas.I have two options, firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, or you can go into partnership with me for proper profitable investment of the money in your country.Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses that might be incured in the process of this transaction.If you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 20% of the total money, while 75% will be for my family and me.

"Dear Friend,Warmest greetings in the name of ALLAH,the most gracious. I pray that he may =grant you the wisdom to understand the pathetic story i am about to tell and =the courage to offer the much needed support i solicite for in this letter.I am a mother of two and the wife of late General YOUSSEF EL HADIDI of the =defuct Republican Guard of ousted President Saddam Hussein . During the hay =days of ex-president Saddam rulership in iraq my late husband was head of =secret Army's procurement unit of the Republican Guard. His position and =resposibility  availed him with so much power and financial liquidity that he =was able to amass substantial amount of money some of which he wisely move to =secret custody  out side iraq. Having forseen the caputilation of Saddam =Hussein government my late husband quietly moved his family (my two kids & I) =to Europe and tried to desert the Iraqi Army to join us in Europe, but was =cought up  with by the dangerosu secret security mechinary  of Saddam. He was =brutally murdered on the order of Saddam himself and all our properties and =estate including bank account were consficated by the infamosu regime. Ever since my kids and i have lived in pennary until we uncovered through the =help of his life -long solicitor some funds he left in a safe custody in =London here.It is for the purpose of entrusting and investing this huge fund with little =or no trace to our family that i send you this propostition. The funds in =question is $35 Million (Thirty Five Million) and is presently deposited in a =trust company awaiting directives from me as my husband next of kin to move =it.It is true that i have never known you but i am desprately in need of =somebody to trust, it has become a matter of expediency and total surrended =to the will of God , the Almighty. If you do  understand my story willing and capable of handling this =trustteeship proposition, kindly oblige me by sending your personal and =business profile including all contact details for us to move forward without =delay. You can reach me direclt on my fax +447092041337.Awaiting your response,Yours truly,"
" Pardon me if I have offended you by contacting you for such a big transaction through an ordinary letter which makes it suspicious considering the type of fraud proposals moving around the world today.  However, I was advised to explain this transaction to you on a face to face meeting. I could not do this because of the situation in the world today not being sure of your reaction. I am Jones Martin, a Consultant and Broker from Kingston Jamaica. I was hired by a Japanese Businessman to broker an investment deal between him and an oil company in Venezuela. This deal was executed in January, 2003 and matured for termination in January 2005. On maturity, the Japanese Businessman and the oil firm decided to terminate the investment in cash to avoid payment of investment tax which amounted to several tens of millions of US Dollars to the American Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  A special arrangement was made between a top Japanese banker working with Japanese bank in New York, the Oil Company and the businessman to terminate the investment in cash payment under a fictitious name, with an arrangement to change it later with a power of attorney which they prepared and handed over to The banker. I was directly involved, well paid and mandated to organized and carry out the deal. All the cash was withdrawn in June 2005 and transported to EUROPE by direct bank vault delivery to a finance company for safekeeping pending the collection. The real content of the boxes was not declared to the storage as it was delivered as personal family treasure worth US$25M.The certificates for the storage, secret codes for the opening of the boxes and its keys were all handed over to me. Mr. Takashi the Florida businessman was planning to go to Europe by August 2005 with me for the collection when the unexpected happened in Hurricane Katrina Mishap, a natural disaster which claimed his life and that of the top banker. This left me devastated and confused as I have not yet handed over the deposit details to the owner and the power of attorney prepared for the change which was signed was still with the banker in his office which was lost.Since last December the diplomatic storage manager has been calling me to bring or tell the owner to come over for collection. Since then, I have been finding any reliable person to collect these consignments under special and well negotiated arrangement until I came across your details. Be rest assured that this transaction has been well organized, 100% safe, legal, and should be kept very confidential. Signify your interest by getting back to me via my email as soon as possible. Regard,Jones Martin"

"  I am the personal account officer to the great late INDUSTRIALIST who had an account in one of the top banks here in South Africa.  Forgive my contact because this letter comes to you as a surprise, as you don't know of it's coming before. My contact is for you to please assist to transfer US$125,000.000.00 ( One hundred & twenty- five million United States dollars only) in tranches from a Prime Bank here in South Africa to any oversea's account(s).

If I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited to the bank.  Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction because of my official position and nature of the deal. The business can be concluded in 10 (ten) banking days .I am sure and have confidence of your ability and reliability to prosecute a transaction of this great magnitude. The account holder was a foreigner and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the accountant of the company. My investigation through the National immigration department proved to me as well that he was single as at the time of his entry into the Republic of South Africa.  The credit balance in this account is USD$125 Million ( One Hundred & Twenty five Million United States Dollars only). Your assistance as a foreigner is necessary because the management of the bank will welcome any foreigner who has correct information on this account which I will disclose to you if you are interested to do this business with me.There is no risk in this business if you follow my instructions. Given my position and my personal rapport with the manager of the bank, the funds can be transferred to any account(s) you nominate .I need an assurance from you that this money will be intact pending my arrival to your bank for disbursements.  State the A/C Details.A/c No:............Bank Name:........A/c Holder:........Beneficiary Name:...  We will start with the first swift wire-transfer of US$25 million( Twenty -five million United States only) Upon successful transfer of the first tranch without any disappointment from your side, you shall apply for the outstanding sum of US $100 Million to the same or other account(s). Armed with correct information as a foreigner and appropriate documentations as we shall arrange I will use my position to secure a prompt conclusion to the transaction.  Your duty is to send me the banking coordinates for the transfer while maintaining the required confidentiality . At the conclusion of the transfer you will receive 35%, 5% will be for any expenses both parties incurred in the process of this business and 60% of the funds will be for me.

"DearPlease let this letter not to bring confusion to you. Iknow that we have not met either before but hear me fromthe dept of your mind. It is circumstances that made tosend this to you.I will introduce myself first to you, My name is VictoriaAbuchi, I lost my mother, my hero and my lord Ms Abu a yearago. She was poisioned to death by her associate inbusiness. She formed a company by one Mr. PhilipBrown who poisioned her only to take benefit of the multimillion venture. He was arrested immedaitely my mother diedand he entered an agreement with my mother's brothers thatI and the immedaite younger brother of my mother willrepresent my mother's interest in the company. After sixmonths I was kicked out of the company because I said thatwe have to change the company's lawyer who I termed waspart of the elimination of my mother. I did not know thatthey have changed all the company's document without myname appearing any where. I will have to let you know moredetail on that but let me move to the point why I amcontacting you.I have been nick named bastard by my mother's relations,They have named me all source of names even calling meoutcast because my mother is late, while my mother was thebread winner of the family. They have pushed me out of mymother's mansion and still want to eliminate my life.I got through the records of my mother account books threeweeks ago while crying and meditating, which I beleive wasinspired by the spirit of God, I discovered that there is ahuge sum of money she deposited in a bank, which is$9,800,000. The note attached to the deposit agreement shemade with the bank indicated that, the money was to be usedto purchase machinery for the establishment of a newcompany of her own.Please all I need from you is to do all you can to help meto get this money out of the bank. I have been to the bankwhere this money is deposited immediately, and confirmedthe account most deligently. The bank told me that mymother informed them that the money was to be remitted toher company's costumer account abroad, which her costumerwill provide to them but since then they have never heardfrom her nor the costumer. Now my mother is late. I don'twant the bank to know that my mother is late. I told themthat she is ill and appointed me to represent her in heraffairs.(1).I want you to provide an account where the money willbe remitted into as my mother's costumer. (2).Makearrangement for me to leave here as soon as possible(3).How much commission you will take for rendering theassistant?My mother did not marry to any man, She had me as the onlychild while she was having an affair with the person thatsurpposed to be my father when she was 18 years and the manabandoned her and disappeared which forced her to remainsingle. Now I am 20 years and never saw my father for aday.I have no home now and my life is in danger. I don'thave any one to run into. All the members of my motherfamily have turned their back on me because I demand for meright. They told me that I don't belong to the family. ThatI should go and look for my father, Whom I don't know. Ihave made trace to know my father without sucess. I wantyou to hear me from the inner most of your heart and accordme this help.God will bless you for saving my life and future.Best wishes,Victoria Abuchi."

"DEAR FRIEND, URGENTLY AND EXTREMELY CONFIDENTIAL. I am an Accountant and the chairman of the tender committee which awards contract in the department of the petroleum Resources of Nigeria . I sent you a letter by post office sometime ago informing you of our plan to transfer the sum of US$20.5million (Twentymillion, Five hundred thousand US Dollars only) to your account. I have been waiting to hear from you,but up till now, nothing has been heard from you hence this particular message. In any case, I guess that you may not have received the letter after all due to the shortcomings of our postal system. I want you to know that this fund originated from an Over-invoiced contract sum which was awarded to a foreign firm in 1999. I and my three (3)other colleagues in the tender Board purposely inflated the actual cost of the contract to the tune of US$20.5Million. However, the original contractor has fully executed the contract, the project commissioned and the contractor paid his actual contract worth, leaving behind the over-invoiced sum. So, itis based on this that we now want you / your company to come forward to claim this sum on our behalf. We are Civil Servants, and we are not allowed to operate foreign account while still in office, so you are therefore to act as one who had executed a contract worth the sum of US$20.5million for my Department and you now want your payment.This deal is 100% risk free. We are perfectly in charged and had worked out modalities that would guarantee a hitch free transfer of this fund to your account. We have also mapped out 30% of the total sum for you for your help and assistance while the remaining is for me and my colleagues. If you are interested in the proposal, and you are a trustworthy person who would not sit on this money if it is transferred to your account,kindly indicate by contacting me through my private telephone/fax numbers,or via my E-mail.You can as well send your bank account details for this transfer. This deal must be kept absolutely confidential till we succeed. Thank you as we look forward to your anticipated co-operation. NOTE =After a successful transfer, 30% for you, 60% for us, 10% mapped out to settle expenses incurred by both parties in the process oftransfer.We will also visit you immedaitely we conclude this transaction to collect and invest our shares of the total sum into any viable business you may advise us in your country. Contact me urgently through my email address  philipsss@noolhar.com  Best regards PAUL P. UCHECHI pls call me on my phone number 234-1-7212507 now for more discussion.___________________________________________________________________________Mail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site- http://yoursite.com"

Jerry as you may recall was Guiliani's homeland security guy in NYC and became B6one of the world's experts. He also worked for Clinton Admn and helped with disaster relief (including earthquakes)around the world. He called me today with some suggestions (some of which may be moot) so I asked him to put theminto a memo. Here it is for what it's worth:I think the fundamental issue is that no one seems to be in charge and noone person has been tasked with trying to pull all of the pieces togetherinto a short term and long term plan. Obviously in the short term searchand rescue and food and water are the main priorities. There seems to belittle communication between the various areas where people have congregatedand a central command post where agencies can call or radio for additionalsupplies including food water and medical.I don't recommend DoD be put in charge of this. They rarely have the kind oftouch that brings together all the necessary agencies under one roof. Iwould set up a central command that has representatives from all federalagencies in one place. There is no reason things should be thisdisorganized. I would break the island into grids and assign one person tobe the coordinator for each of the grids. That person will be responsiblefor all activities within their grid and will report activities to theisland on-scene coordinator. We should get a radio company like Motorola toset up temporary towers and give the State Department several hundred radiosso everyone involved in the response is able to communicate with the commandpost and with each other.I think one of the most important roles for DoD is to provide security forthe rescue teams and medical teams. They also should be responsible for theoperation of the airport for off loading planes and for scheduling allincoming flights so there is no lost time waiting for planes to land. I alsothink DoD should be responsible for airlifting supplies that are requestedby each one of the grid coordinators. Additionally the helicopters shouldbe used to move critical patients to the hospital ship on the way and to theaircraft carrier currently on station. At least once a day the coordinatorassigned by the President and the Secretary of State should be responsiblefor getting situation reports from all agencies on site particularlyregarding food and water security medical and search and rescue.The lack of command and control is allowing the situation to become morechaotic rather than more coordinated. I believe that if the Secretary wereto talk to the other nations involved through the UN they would besupportive of better coordination.Bottom line is that there is no order to the operation and you need strongpeople in there who can speak on behalf of the President and the Secretaryand get things under control quickly.I hope this is helpful. If you or the Secretary have any questions pleasefeel free to call me on my cell We leave for Tokyo at 7:15 amtomorrow and transfer to a United flight due back in DC at 2:30 pm tomorrow.Please give the Secretary my best regards. I hope to see you soon.B6
I am and would like to talk before 8 if you can. Thx.

"Dear Friend,I apologize if the contents in this mail are contrary to your moral ethics, which I feel may be of great disturbance to your personal life, But please treat with absolute secrecy and personal. I pray that this email reaches you in the best of health.I am Mr Denguele djaratigui, the manager of bill and  exchange at the foreign remittance department Bank Of Africa. In my  department we discoveredan  abandoned sum of US$14.5M (fourteen million five  hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our  foreign customer who died along with his family in the 2000 in a plane crash.Since we got information about his death, we have  been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless   some body applies for it as next of kin or relation  to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guide lines and lawsbut  unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died  alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now  decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is  coming for it and we don't want this  money to  go  into the bank treasury as   unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that  if such money remained unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank  treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner  as next of kin in this  business is occasioned bythe fact that the customer  was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 45% of this money will be for you as  respect to the provision of a foreign account , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the  business and 50% be for me.Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this  fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the  bank as relation or  next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account  number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effectivecommunication and location where the money will be  transfer.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by  fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your  notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you  receive this mail,Trusting to hear from you immediately.Yours faithfully.Mr Denguele djaratigui,"

"Greetings to you. From Richard Ohene,Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it with seriousness. This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. My name is Richard Ohene, the present branch Manager of a bank here in Ghana. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like I said,I have a transaction that will benefit both of us, as your assistance is required as a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head office, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our branch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the present Manager anddiscovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an account with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has not been operated on for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I found out that this accountbelongs to one Late Mr. ANDREAS SCHRANNER a German great industrialist and a resident of Munich, who unfortunately lost his life along with his entire famillies in the plane crash of CONCORDE AIRLINE[Flight AF4590 ] which crashed on 25TH JULY, 2000. You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site, which I got during my investigation; <http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm>. The account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank and no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a closemonitoring of the account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money as next of kin to the late Mr. Andreas Schranner, meaning that no one is aware of the account. I cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and share it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the nextof kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you.I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the account, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you. There is practically no risk involved, the transaction will beexecuted under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. Thanking you in advance and may God bless,Richard Ohene"

"sbwhoeopWednesday August 25 2010 10:52 AMworth reading even if you know the IntelB6H: I'm sure you know the facts in this well-informed piece how Mullah Omar was saved by ISI for example but the ideaof Afghanistan as an aspect of lndo-Pak war is the best and overarching strategic concept. Sidhttp://www.newstatesman.com/asia/2010/08/india-pakistan-afghanistaniNT aLOSEThe military and the mullahsWilliam DalrymplePublished 23 August 2010The Pakistani state has a long history of nurturing jihadis as a means of dominating Afghanistan and undermining India.It is proving a fatal alliance.It May have been a nightmarish year for Pakistan but it has been a pretty good one for the country's inscrutable chief ofarmy staff the most powerful man in the Land of the Pure General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.For a start the army's response to the floods has compared well to the usual corrupt incompetence of Pakistan's civilianpoliticians guided by their chateau-hopping president Asif Ali Zardari (while minister for investment he was nicknamed""Mr 10 Per Cent""; he has now been upgraded to ""Mr 110 Per Cent""). This has led to discussion in army circles aboutwhether it is time to drop the civilian fig leaf and return the country to the loving embrace of its military. So serious is thisthreat that one of the country's most senior and well-connected journalists. Najam Sethi editor-in-chief of the FridayTimes went on the record this month to warn that elements in the army were plotting yet another coup.""( know this isdefinitely being discussed"" he said.Then there was the news that Kayani was going to be allowed to keep his job for a second term: ""an extraordinarysituation requires an extraordinary decision to overcome it"" explained a brigadier writing in the Nation newspaper.Kayani a former head of Pakistan's notorious intelligence agency the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISO can now continueto run the army and by default Pakistan's foreign policy until November 2013.But Kayani's biggest triumph this year arguably the greatest of his career was his visit to Kabul in July as the honouredguest of the Afghan president Hamid Karzai. The visit marked an important thawing in Pak-Afghan relations whichhave been glacial ever since Karzai came to power in 2001. It also coincided with the sacking of Amrullah SalehKarzai's pro-Indian and rabidly anti-ISI former security chief. Saleh is a tough Tajik who rose to prominence as amujahedin protege of Ahmed Shah Massoud the Indian-backed ""Lion of Panjshir"". The Taliban and their sponsors inthe ISI had regarded Saleh as their fiercest opponent something Saleh was enormously proud of.When I had dinner with him in Kabul in May he spoke at length of his frustration with the ineffectiveness of Karzai'sgovernment in taking the fight to the Taliban and the extent to which the ISI was managing to aid arm and train itspuppet insurgents in North Waziristan and Balochistan. Saleh's sacking gave notice of an important change of directionby Karzai. As Bruce Riedel Barack Obama's Af-Pak adviser said when the news broke ""it means that Karzai is alreadyplanning for a post-American Afghanistan"". â¢It seems that Kayani and Karzai are discussing some sort of accommodation between the Afghan government and ISI-sponsored elements in the Taliban maybe those of Sirajuddin Haqqani which could give over much of the Pashtunsouth to pro-Pakistan Taliban but preserve Karzai in power in Kabul after the US withdrawal. The expulsion of IndiaPakistan's great regional rival from Afghanistan or at least the closing of its four regional consulates would be a toppriority for the ISI in return for any deal that kept Karzai in power.With the US toppling of the Taliban after the 11 September 2001 attacks Pakistan's influence disappeared abruptly fromAfghanistan andIndia quickly filled the vacuum. To the ISI's horror in the early years of this decade India provided reconstructionassistance and training worth roughly Â£835m in total. It also built roads sanitation projects the new Afghan parliamentand free medical facilities across the country. It even offered to help train the Afghan army. Nato refused. As GeneralStanley McChrystal put it in a report last year ""while Indian activities largely benefit the Afghan people increasing Indianinfluence in Afghanistan is likely to exacerbate regional tensions and encourage Pakistani countermeasures"".McChrystal was right. The Pakistanis have always been paranoid about the small Indian presence in Afghanistan. ""Wehave strong evidence [that India is] using Afghanistan against Pakistan's interests to destabilise Pakistan"" a foreignministry spokesman claimed in March. Pakistan's military establishment terrified of the economic superpower emergingto the south believes it would be suicide to accept an Indian presence in what it regards as its Afghan backyard - apotential point of retreat for the army in the event of an Indian invasion something Pakistani analysts refer to as vital""strategic depth"".According to Indian diplomatic sources there are still fewer than 3600 Indians in Afghanistan; there are only ten Indiandiplomatic officers as opposed to nearly 150 in the UK embassy. Yet the horror of being encircled has led the ISI to riskPakistan's relationship with its main strategic ally the US in order to keep the Taliban in play and its leadership underISI patronage in Quetta - a policy Kayani developed while head of the IS!. Karzai's new deal with the Pakistanis and hisclear intention to try to reach some accommodation with their proxies among the Taliban therefore represents a majorstrategic victory for Kayani and Pakistan's military as well as a grave diplomatic defeat for India.Pakistan's support for the Taliban today is only the most recent chapter of an old story of complicity between jihadimovements and the Pakistani state. Since the days of the anti-Soviet mujahedin Pakistan's army saw violent Islamicgroups as an ingenious and cost-effective means of both dominating Afghanistan (which they finally achieved with theretreat of the Soviets in 1987) and bogging down the Hindu-dominated Indian army in Kashmir (which they managedwith great effect from 1990 onwards).The former ISI director and Dick Dastardly lookalike Hamid Gul who was largely responsible for developing the strategyonce said to me: ""If the jihadis go out and contain India tying down one rnillion men of their army on their own soil for alegitimate cause why should we not support them?"" Next to Gul in his Islamabad living room lay a piece of the BerlinWall presented to him by the city's people for ""delivering the first blow"" to the Soviet empire through his use of jihadis inthe 1980s. The WikiLeaks documents suggest he is still busy liaising with jihadis in his ""retirement"".The Pakistani military top brass were long convinced that they could control the militants they have nurtured. In a tapedconversation between President Pervez Musharraf and Muhammad Aziz Khan his chief of general staff that Indiareleased in 1999 Aziz said the army had the jihadis by their ""tooti"" (balls). Yet the Islamists have increasingly followedtheir own agendas sending suicide bombers out against not just Pakistan's religious minorities and political leaders buteven the IS! headquarters. Nonetheless many in the army still believe the jihadis are a more practical defence againstIndian hegemony than nuclear weapons. For them supporting Islamist groups is not an ideological or religious whim somuch as a practical and patriotic imperative - a vital survival strategy for a Pakistani state.The army and ISI continued this duplicitous and risky policy after 11 September 2001 despite Musharrafs publicpromises to the contrary. The speed with which the US lost interest in Afghanistan after its invasion and embarked onplans to invade Iraq convinced the Pakistani army that the Washington had no long-term commitment to Karzai'sregime. This led to the generals keeping the Taliban in reserve to be used to reinstal a pro-Pakistani regime in Kabulonce the American gaze had turned elsewhere.So it was that the .ISI gave refuge to the leadership of the Taliban after it fled from Afghanistan in 2001. MullahMohammed Omar was kept in an IS! safehouse in Quetta; his militia was lodged in the sprawling suburb ofPashtunabad. There Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar presided over the Taliban military committee and war chest.Gulbuddin Hekmatyar the leader of Hizb-e-lslami was lured back from exile in Iran and allowed to operate freelyoutside Peshawar while Jalaluddin Haqqani one of the most violent Taliban commanders was given sanctuary in NorthWaziristan. Other groups were despatched to safehouses in Balochistan.By 2004 the US had filmed Pakistani army trucks delivering Taliban fighters at the Afghan border and recovering thema few days later; wireless monitoring at the US base at Bagram picked up Taliban commanders arranging with Pakistaniarmy officers at the border for safe passage as they came in and out of Afghanistan. Western intelligence agenciesconcluded that the ISI was running a full training programme for the Afghan Taliban turning a blind eye as they raisedfunds in the Gulf and allowing them to import materiel mainly via Dubai. By 2005 the Taliban with covert Pakistanisupport were launching a full-scale assault on Nato troops in Afghanistan and being given covering fire as they returnedto their bases in Pakistan.At the same time Taliban attacks on Indian interests in Afghanistan intensified beginning the process of turning theAfghan conflict like that in Kashmir into what it is today: an lndo-Pak proxy war. The Indian embassy in Kabul was twicebombed - in July 2008 and October 2009 - as were two city-centre hotels thought to have been used by the Researchand Analysis Wing (Raw) the Indian intelligence agency. Seven Indian civilians and two Indian military officers died inthe blasts.The degree to which the ISI has been controlling the Afghan Taliban has only just become clear and not just in thedocuments published by WikiLeaks. A report by Matt Waldman of the Carr Centre for Human Rights at Harvard basedon interviews with ten former senior Taliban commanders closely documents how the IS! ""orchestrates sustains andstrongly influences"" the Taliban and shows how the !SI is even represented on the Taliban's supreme leadershipcouncil the Quetta Shura.Meanwhile in the Punjab Hafiz Mohammad Saeed founder of Lashkar-e-Toiba and the man believed to have beenbehind the 2008 Bombay attacks has been allowed to continue operating from Muridke near Lahore. ""The powerfulwestern world is terrorising Muslims"" he told a conference in Islamabad this year. ""We are being invaded manipulatedand looted. We must fight the evil trio of America Israel and India. Suicide missions are in accordance with Islam. Infact a suicide attack is the best form of jihad.""At the same time as Pursuing its policy of selectively using jihadis Pakistan has appeased the US by giving generousassistance to the CIA in arresting foreign Arab al-Qaeda personnel. A major assault was also launched against both themilitants who took over the Lal Masjid and the ultra-radical Pakistan Taliban who took over the Swat Valley andannounced their intention of turning the country into an Islamic Emirate. In the course of these operations and others inthe Federally Administered Tribal Areas more than 1500 Pakistani soldiers and policemen were killed; another 250000people were made homeless in the Pak army assault on Bajaur. The IS1 has even been prepared to arrest any membersof the Afghan Taliban who didn't follow orders. Hence the seizure in Karachi in February of the Taliban second-in-command Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar along with aboutia dozen other senior Taliban whom the ISI regarded asinfringing on their hospitality by opening talks with the Karzai administration via the Saudis without ISI clearance.Yet even though the Pakistani army has conducted major offensives in six of the tribal areas the seventh NorthWaziristan has been left alone as it is home to the ISI's favourite proxies: Haqqani and Hekmatyar. Similarly Pakistan'sfoot-dragging response to the 2008 attacks on Bombay and the lack of response to the attacks on minority faith groupsin Pakistan over the past few months show that the Janus-faced policy remains in place. This summer the chiefminister of the Punjab Shahbaz Sharif was quoted heatedly denying that there were any militant groups working in thePakistani Punjab or that the Punjabi Taliban even existed. There are still in the eyes of many in the Pakistaniestablishment good Taliban and bad Taliban useful militants and expendable ones.In their eyes the ongoing defeat of Nato in Afghanistan with US and British troops suffering record casualties lastmonth is a vindication of its long-term strategy. Islamabad has succeeded in regaining influence in Afghanistan andDelhi has been checked. But India will not take this lying down. Already the Indian press has reported attempts to -resuscitate the Northern Alliance as a contingency against the Taliban's takeover of the south and here India is workingin conjuction with Russia Iran and the central Asian ""stans"". The Indian national security adviser Shivshankar Menonwas despatched to Afghanistan in March and the foreign minister S M Krishna has visited Tehran. Post-AmericanAfghanistan is looking increasingly likely to be divided between the Tajik Uzbek and Hazara north and the Pashtunsouth either formally with a partition or more likely to slip into inter-ethnic civil war with India supporting and armingthe north and Pakistan the south.As diplomacy gathers pace the Afghan Taliban who already control over 70 per cent of the country. continue toincrease their power. The most worrying development has been the spread of Taliban units to the previously peacefulnorth where they have taken over pockets of Pathan settlement around Kunduz and Badakhshan. The death of theBritish aid worker Karen Woo on 5 August was a direct result.In Pakistan. too jihadi activity is growing. Last year there were 87 suicide attacks across the country killing roughly3000 people and the ISI this week stated that for the first time in the nation's history it regarded home-grown Islamicmilitants to be a bigger threat to the integrity of the nation than India. Yet the army continues to obsess about India. In arecent speech Kayani emphasised that although the army knows the dangers of militancy it was against Indian attacksthat he was principally focused. At a time when Pakistan's economy is in crisis electricity supply increasingly erratic andthe educational system in complete breakdown Kayani has secured a huge increase in the country's defence budget.It is not a pretty picture: growing violence everywhere increasing Indo-Pak tensions and a defeat for western interests inthe region. Worst of all because the Pakistani army regards this as a major triumph it is unlikely to change its policy anytime soon.William Dalrymple's ""Nine Lives: in Search of the Sacred in Modern India"" won the first Asia House Literary Award inMay and is newly published in paperback (Bloomsbury Â£8.99)"

"     My Dear Respectful , My name is Frank kone a Banker and accountant in =Cote Ivoire.I am contacting you in regards to a business transfer of a larg=e sum of money from a dormant account. Though I know that a transaction of =this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assurin=g you that all will be well at the end of the day.I am the personal accounts manager to the late Engr lake a National of your= country, who used to work with an oil servicing company here in Cote Ivoir=e.My client, his wife, and their three children were involved in the ill fa=ted Kenya Airways crash in the coasts of Abidjan in January 2000 in which a=ll passengers on board died. Since then I have made several inquiries to yo=ur embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives but has been unsu=ccessful.After several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his last name over =the internet,to see if I could locate any member of his family hence I cont=acted you.Of particular interest is this huge deposit with our bank here in= my country Cote Diviore,where the deceased has an account valued at about =($16 million US dollars).They have issued me a notice to provide the next o=f kin or our  bank will declare the account unservisable and thereby send t=he funds to the bank treasury. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating t=he relatives for over last 7 years now, I will seek your consent to present= you as the next of kin of the deceased since you have the same last names,= so that the proceeds of this account valued at ($16million US dollars) can= be paid to you and then you and I can share the money.All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through=.I guarantee that this will be executed under all legitimate arrangement th=at will protect you from any breach of the law.=20In your reply mail, I want you to give me your full names, address, date of= birth, telephone and fax numbers.If you can handle this with me, reach me = for more details.=20Thanking you for your anticipated cooperation.  Sincerely,Frank kone.=20_________________________________________________________________Make every IM count. Download Windows Live Messenger and join the i=92m Ini=tiative now.

"Confidential and Urgent matterI believe you are a busy person, please let me brieflyoutline Our agenda, and then, I will proceed to give youdetails.I am Mrs. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha the Only Wife of presentGovernor of Bayelsa State of Republic of Nigeria I knowthat it may surprise you being emailed by a strange Womanfrom African country asking for urgent assistance in anurgent deal. The reason why I decided to involve you inthis deal is due to what my husband is  experiencing inLondon at present, when he was arrested with 1 .5 millioinpound sterling in his guest house in london recently.CHECK THESE LINK OUT; http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4253362.stm http://www.nigeriaworld.comBecause of this terrible experience I decided that morningabout the money (USD$120Millions) left behind here in statehouse,I was afraid of putting the fund in the Bank, becauseI have to give account to the bank on how I got the money.I then packaged the fund in consignments and deposited theconsignments with a security/courier company. I did notwant the management of the Security Company to know thecontent of the consignments, therefore I registered thecontent of the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the securitycompany believes that  what I deposited with them was GoldBars.I have notified the Security Company where I deposited theconsignments that contained the fund, that I am moving theconsignment abroad and the security company has since beenwaiting for my authority for the consignment to leave mycountry and move to abroad. If you know that you handle .receive such big funds"
"B/958/042/0500 came to our bank to engage inbusiness discussions with our P=rivate Banking Services Department. He informed us that he had a financial =portfolio of 14.37 million United StatesDollars, I was the officer assigned to his case;  In line with instr=uctions,the money was deposited; he told me he wanted the money there in an=ticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last co=mmunication we had, this transpired around February 25th 2004. I made futile efforts to locate him I immediately  Four days later, information s=tarted to trickle in, that he was apparently dead, a person who suited his =description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of France.= it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politic=s of the banking world aberrational. There isUSD$13,991,674(Thirteen millio=n, nine hundred and ninety one thousand, six hundred and seventy four unite=d states dollars) deposited, I alone have thedeposit details and they will =release the deposit to no one unless Iinstruct them to do so. My proposal; =I am prepared to place you in a position whereby an instruction is given to= the finance firm to officially release the deposit to you as the closest s=urviving relation/associate,and all etiquette shall be done in accordance w=ith the rule of law, Iwillsimply nominate you as the next of kin and have t=hem release the deposit to you; afterwards we share the proceeds 50/50.

PIR <preinesThursday September 2 2010 6:33 PMHCDM; Huma Abedin; Lona Valmoro; Jake SullivanJoint InterviewMS âJake just relayed yoLir desire to cancel tomorrow's interview. But I want to make sure you are aware of a few things thathe was not in a position to share:1) The Israeli & Palestinian interviewers and their teams skipped returning home today with their principals at greatcost and energy in order to stay the extra day to you. One skipped traveling onward with Abbas.2) Both the Israeli & Palestinian media outlets involved immediately announced their joint interview and are hyping itsunprecedented nature3) Because of #2 U.S. media is fully aware that this interview is scheduled for tomorrow morning.So three points:1) There is an incredibly high expectation for this interview occurring and canceling no matter the reason cited will betaken to mean something negative2) The point of this interview was to shape the narrative coming out of today andcanceling will only contribute to a negative narrative in that we will be canceling on the most important figure in Israelimedia and I do not see Channel 2 taking that well3) As positive as the symbolism of this interview was meant to bewe run the risk of the negative symbolism by canceling.Typically when you want to cancel something I roll with it. But I want to strenuously object to doing so in this case. Iunderstand you told the participants they should refrain from public comment but first that doesn't mean you have toand second you know they won't really refrain. And I am certain they will appreciate the effusive things you have to sayabout them during this interview. Not to mention that the reason for canceling is something we ourselves could haveforeseen before going so far down the road and should have - which I don't think is fair or reflects well on you.Lastly on a much more practical note: to get you out of this I am going to have to bribe Channel 2 with a significant andexclusive interview when we are in Jerusalem in two weeks and I guarantee you that will be far more painful thantomorrow's relative short and peaceful format.If you'd like to discuss I'm at my desk and available or can call you through Ops.

"Dear Sir.  May I seek your indulgence to introduce my humble  self. I am Kokor Mobutu, the son of the late Zaire Republic President, Mobutu Sese Seko. Before the death of my father, he kept in my custody the sum of USD 30 Million ( Thirty million United States Dollars ) this money emanated from the sales of diamonds he made when he was still on the throne.  My father lodged this money in a security company outside our country for security reasons and because of the political instability in my country.   My Father introduced me to the security company       shortly before his death. He however deposited this money without any name rather, with coded numbers which is in my possession. With my father dead, my life was at great risk, I therefore had to leave my country under cover to Spain.  Now, I have decided to invest this money in a suitable and conducive environment. At this point, I now seek your assistance to transfer this money to your bank account for proper use. 20% of the total money will be yours after the transfer and 5% for any expenditure we might incur in the process while the balance will be for me.  On the receipt of your positive response to assist me on this project, all information related to the project will be made available to you on request. This business is 100% risk free as long as the confidentiality the business needs is observed. For this business to take off, your bank particulars where this fund will be paid into is required.  You can always reach me on my E Mail address,kokormobutu@yahoo.co.uk or telephone number-00 346 099 146 24   Warm Regards,  Kokor   "

"{ASYLUM SEEKER} BANGKOK,THAILAND  Attn,Sir/Madam,  I got to know of you in my search for a reputable person/company to assist me in an urgent matter/business that would certainly boost the financial standard of all parties involved when completed, which also requires utmost trust and confidentiality.  I am Mr. Leonard Welsh Taylor, first son to late Mr.Darby Assinga Taylor. who died last 3 years in the crisis in liberia, western Africa. My late father is an aide to exile president Charles Taylor, died as a result of uprising against his Government by rebel groups.  Meanwhile, before the death of my father he had taken me to Bangkok Thailand to deposit the sum of SEVEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US Dollars ($7.5million US Dollars) in january 2001 at a Security Company. Initially, he intended investing this money in a garment factory in Bangkok, before the rebel forces assasinated him. This money was deposited as Gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was part of millions of dollars the president mapped out for the purchase of ammunitions,militaryhard/softwares,light and heavy duty vehicles and other defensive logistics. My late father sensing the weakness of the ruling Government, he took me to Thailand in january to deposit the money in a private security company as family valuables of containing gemstones and financial documents.  As he returned from arms negotiation from eastern Europe, he was assasinated by the rebels forces on 11 april 2002 which prompted me to seek asylum in Thailand where the money and the whole documents are with me right now. This resulted to killing and mass action by the government and rebel soldiers. Infact, a lot of people have been killed and they are still killing uptill now because of this war of which my father was one of the victims. Perhaps, if you are conversant with world news you can understand me better.  It is against this background that I am soliciting need your assistance to help and provide a foreign account for us especially sourcing for reliable and trustworthy ventures where the money will be invested when transferred to your account in your country, Since the law of Thailand prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to operate a bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction.  I am in  now saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account into which this money can be transferred without the knowledge of my home government who are bent on taking everything we have got. At the moment, We are faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in Thailand for fear of seizure or going through this same experience or seizure because of terrorist activitiesarcotics agencies.  I am soliciting your willingness to help me explore possible areas we can invest our money in your country.and in a profitable business I would equally appreciate your willingness to help me relocate my immediate family of three to your country where I will invest the fund.The cash is ($7.5 MILLION US DOLLARS) means for the would-be project is under my custody. I will therefore appreciate it, if you can travel to meet with me in bangkok,Thailand, hence my permit (Refugee) only allows us to make a single trip out of the country gurranted asylum.Again to enable us have a memorandum of understanding, discuss on likely profitable and reliable ventures where the money will be invested in your country and and also promise you 20% per! cent of the total fund for your assistance and support in making the transfer a success. after the consignment is released from storage.  This transaction will be successfully concluded within 14 days if you accord me your unalloyed and due cooperation and willing to assist me, please reply me and include your private E-mail/fax and telephone number. Note That this business is 100% risk free and your coming down here "

"Did this with Sean. SidThe Political SceneConfounding FathersThe Tea Party's Cold War roots.by Sean Wilentz October 18 2010ann Beck's view of American history stems from the paranoid politics of the fifties.A few months ago the cable-television and radio host Glenn Beck began his Fox News show with one of his favoriteprops: a pipe clenched between his teeth. ""I've got my pipe"" he told his audience his speech slightly muddled by thestem ""because we're going to speak about schoolish kind of things."" The theme of the day was ""Restoring History"" andBeck looking professorial in a neat dark blazer and a pink button-down shirt began the lesson by peering at a stack ofhistory textbooks and pronouncing them full of falsehoods produced by ""malicious progressive intent."" Progressives heexplainedâliberals socialists Communists the entire spectrum of the leftâ""knew they had to separate us from ourhistory to be able to separate us from our Constitution and God."" For the next hour Beck earnestly explained some of thehistory that ""is being stolen from us"": the depression of 1920 for example or how conservative economics saved thenation from the ""near-depression"" of 1946âcrises that progressives don't want you to know about. ""You've been taughtone lie I think your whole life"" he said.For the fractious Tea Party movement Beckâa former drive-time radio jockey a recovering alcoholic and a Mormonconvertâhas emerged as both a unifying figure and an intellectual guide. One opinion poll released in July byDemocracy Corps showed that he is ""the most highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters"" seen not merelyas an entertainer like Rush Limbaugh but as an ""educator."" And in the past few months Beck has established his owninstitute of learning: the online for-profit Beck University. Enrollees can take courses like Faith 102 which contends with""revisionists and secular progressives"" about the separation of church and state; Hope 102 an attack on the activistfederal government; and the combined Charity 101/102/103 a highly restrictive interpretation of rights federalism and thedivision of powers.During the ""Restoring History"" episode Beck twice encouraged viewers to join his Web seminars where they can hear""lessons from the best and brightest historians and scholars that we could find."" The B.U. faculty consists of threemembers including one bona-fide academic James R. Stoner Jr. the chair of the political-science department atLouisiana State University; the other two are the head of a management consulting firm and the founder of WallBuilderswhich the Web site calls ""a national pro-family organization."" Beck himself often acts as a professor a slightly jocular oneon his Fox News program. Surrounded by charts and figures he offers explanations of current politics and history lessonsabout the country's long march to Obama-era totalitarianism. The decline he says began with the Progressive era of theearly twentieth century in particular with the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson when both the Federal Reserve System andthe graduated federal income tax came into existence. ""Wilson"" Beck told his radio audience in August ""just despisedwhat America was.""Beck's claims have found an audience among Tea Party spokesmen and sympathizers. At the movement's FreedomSummit in Washington last September one activist told a reporter ""The election between Teddy Roosevelt and WoodrowWilson in 1912 was when it started going downhill."" And in April an angry member of the Tea Party Patriots group fromCape Fear North Carolina claimed on the group's Web site that ""the very things you see happening in this country todaystarted with the Wilson Administration.""At a Tax Day rally this past spring the veteran conservative organizer Richard Viguerie described the Tea Party as ""anunfettered new force of the middle class."" And indeed calling Obama a socialist in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson isaudacious enough to seem like the marker of a new movementâor at least a new twist in the nation's long history ofconspiracy-mongering. In fact it marks a revival of ideas that circulated on the extremist right half a century agoespecially in the John Birch Society and among its admirers.Beck's version of American history relies on lessons from his own acknowledged inspiration the late right-wing writer W.Cleon Skousen and also restates charges made by the Birch Society's founder Robert Welch. The political universe isof course very different today from what it was during the Cold War. Yet the Birchers' politics and their view of Americanhistoryâwhich focussed more on totalitarian threats at home than on those posed by the Soviet Union and CommunistChinaâhas proved remarkably persistent. The pressing historical question is how extremist ideas held at bay for decadesinside the Republican Party have exploded anewâand why this time Party leaders have done virtually nothing tochallenge those ideas and a great deal to abet them.The early nineteen-sixties were a turbulent time in American politics for the right wing in particular. In the South racistviolence against civil-rights workers was constant deepening sectional splits in the Democratic Party that would in timedeliver the once solidly Democratic South to the Republicans. Southern elected officials in support of what they called""massive resistance"" to civil-rights laws and judicial rulings resurrected the ideas of nullification and interposition whichclaimed that individual states could void federal laws within their own borders. Others focussed on what they considered afearsome Communist menace inside the United States. General Edwin A. Walker caused an enormous stir when heresigned from the Army in 1961 after President John F. Kennedy's Pentagon reprimanded him for spreading right-wingpropaganda among his troops and accusing prominent American officials of Communist sympathies. Senator StromThurmond the Dixiecrat from South Carolina spoke for many on the far right when he declared that various modestlyliberal domestic programs ""fall clearly within the category of socialism.""The John Birch Society was one of the decade's most controversial right-wing organizations. Founded in 1958 by RobertWelch a candy manufacturer from Massachusetts the society took its name from a Baptist missionary and military-intelligence officer killed by Communist Chinese forces in 1945 whom Welch called the first American casualty of theCold War. The group was founded at a propitious time. After Senator Joseph McCarthy's fall in 1954 many of McCarthy'sfollowers felt bereft of a voice and Welch seemed to speak for them; by the mid-sixties his society's membership wasestimated to be as high as a hundred thousand. Welch exploiting fears of what McCarthy had called an ""immense""domestic conspiracy declared that the federal government had already fallen into the Communists' clutches. In a tracttitled ""The Politician"" he attacked President Dwight D. Eisenhower as ""a dedicated conscious agent of the Communistconspiracy"" who had been serving the plot ""all of his adult life."" Late in 1961 after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion heaccused the Kennedy Administration of ""helping the Communists everywhere in the world while pretending to do theopposite.""Wherever he looked Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic and foreign policy on behalf oftotalitarianism. But within the United States he believed the subversion had actually begun years before the BolshevikRevolution. Conflating modern liberalism and totalitarianism Welch described government as ""always and inevitably anenemy of individual freedom."" Consequently he charged the Progressive era which expanded the federal government'srole in curbing social and economic ills was a dire period in our history and Woodrow Wilson ""more than any other oneman started this nation on its present road to totalitarianism.""In the nineteen-sixties Welch became convinced that even the Communist movement was but ""a tool of the totalconspiracy."" This master conspiracy he said had forerunners in ancient Sparta and sprang fully to life in the eighteenthcentury in the ""uniformly Satanic creed and program"" of the Bavarian Illuminati. Run by those he called ""the Insiders"" theconspiracy resided chiefly in international families of financiers such as the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers governmentagencies like the Federal Reserve System and the Internal Revenue Service and nongovernmental organizations like theBilderberg Group the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. Since the early twentieth century theyhad done a good deal of their evil work under the guise of humanitarian uplift. ""One broad avenue down which theseconspiratorial forces advance was known as progressive legislation"" Welch declared in 1966. ""The very same collectivisttheories and demagogic pretenses which had destroyed earlier civilizations were now paraded forth in the disguise of newand modern concepts.""In the worst case Welch believed military action might be necessary to dislodge the totalitarians. But for the moment anonviolent political revolution would suffice. Accordingly he designed the Birch Society roughly if not explicitly on theMarxist-Leninist model of a vanguard revolutionary party: a series of small cells that would work in secret to agitate thepopulace and elect right-thinking candidates to office. ""It isn't numbers we have to worry about"" Welch wrote ""but thecourage on the part of our followers to stick their necks out and play roughâthe same as the Communists do.""The ""Founder"" himself would dictate the society's policies advised by a council of about two dozen businessmen andprofessionals and the local cells would be overseen by unyielding commanders. ""It is the leadership that is mostdemanding most exacting of its followers"" Welch observed ""that achieves really dedicated support."" Welch's groupbecame synonymous with right-wing extremism earning satirical blasts from critics ranging from the cartoonist Walt Kellyto the musicians Bob Dylan and Dizzy Gillespie. The trumpeter whose actual name was John Birks Gillespie made ahumorous run for the Presidency in 1964 organizing John Birks Societies in twenty-five states.Still the most outlandish of the era's right-wing anti-Communists was not Welch but Willard Cleon Skousen. Atransplanted Canadian who served as a Mormon missionary in his teens Skousen was considered so radical in the earlynineteen-sixties that even J. Edgar Hoover's F.B.I. watched him closely; one 1962 memo in his extensive F.B.I. file notedthat ""during the past year or so Skousen has affiliated himself with the extreme right-wing 'professional communists' whoare promoting their own anticommunism for obvious financial purposes."" Skousen was himself employed by the F.B.I.from 1935 until 1951 much of that time as a special agent working chiefly in administration. These desk jobs he claimedimplausibly gave him access to confidential domestic intelligence about Communism. Skousen also maintained that hehad served as Hoover's administrative assistant; Hoover informed inquirers that there was no such position.Skousen taught for years in the speech and religion departments at Brigham Young University interrupted by a stint from1956 to 1960 as the police chief of Salt Lake City. His time in office was contentious and after he raided a friendly cardgame attended by the city's right-wing mayor J. Bracken Lee he was promptly fired. Lee called Skousen ""a master of halftruths"" and said that he ran the police department ""like a Gestapo""; Skousen's supporters placed burning crosses on theMayor's lawn.After losing his police job Skousen founded a group called the All-American Society which Time described in 1961 as anexemplar of the far-right ""ultras."" Although he did not join the Birch Society Skousen worked with its American OpinionSpeakers' Bureau and in 1963 wrote a rousing tract titled ""The Communist Attack on the John Birch Society"" whichcondemned the society's critics for ""promoting the official Communist Party line."" (This was a tic of Skousen's; he laterdefended the Mormon policy of denying the priesthood to blacks with a pamphlet called ""The Communist Attack on theMormons."")All along Skousen's evolving thoughts ran in tandem with Welch's. In ""The Naked Communist"" a lengthy primerpublished in 1958 he enlivened a survey of the worldwide leftist threat with outlandish claims writing that F.D.R.'s adviserHarry Hopkins had treasonously delivered to the Soviets a large supply of uranium and that the Russians built the firstSputnik with plans stolen from the United States. A year before Richard Condon's novel ""The Manchurian Candidate""appeared Skousen announced that the Communists were creating ""a regimented breed of Pavlovian men whose mindscould be triggered into immediate action by signals from their masters."" A later book ""The Naked Capitalist"" decried theIvy League Establishment who through the Federal Reserve the Council on Foreign Relations and the RockefellerFoundation formed ""the world's secret power structure."" The conspiracy had begun Skousen wrote when reformers likethe wealthy banker Edward M. (Colonel) House a close adviser to President Woodrow Wilson helped put into place theFederal Reserve and the graduated income tax.In 1971 Skousen organized another group the Freemen Institute which he later renamed the National Center forConstitutional Studies. According to an article published in the Review of Religious Research the center's targetsincluded ""the Occupational Safety and Health Administration the Environmental Protection Agency the FederalCommunication Commission's fairness doctrine in editorial broadcasting the federal government's change of the goldstandard in currency all subsidies to farmers all federal aid to education all federal social welfare foreign aid socialsecurity elimination of public school prayer and Bible reading and (that familiar right-wing nemesis) the United Nations.""Skousen's pronouncements made him a pariah among most conservative activists including some on the right-wingfringe. In 1962 the ultraconservative American Security Council threw him out because members felt that he had ""goneoff the deep end."" In 1971 a review in the Mormon journal Dialogue accused Skousen of ""inventing fantastic ideas andmaking inferences that go far beyond the bounds of honest commentary"" and advancing doctrines that came ""perilouslyclose"" to Nazism. And in 1979 after Skousen called President.Jimmy Carter a puppet of the Council on Foreign Relationsand the Rockefeller family the president of the Mormon church issued a national order banning announcements about hisorganizations.Skousen was undeterred. In 1981 he produced ""The 5000 Year Leap"" a treatise that assembles selective quotationsand groundless assertions to claim that the U.S. Constitution is rooted not in the Enlightenment but in the Bible and thatthe framers believed in minimal central government. Either proposition would have astounded James Madison oftendescribed as the guiding spirit behind the Constitution who rejected state-established religions and like AlexanderHamilton proposed a central government so strong that it could veto state laws. ""The 5000 Year Leap"" is not a fervidbook. Instead it is calmly ingratiatingly misleading. Skousen quotes various eighteenth-century patriots on the evils ofwhat Samuel Adams in 1768 called ""the Utopian schemes of leveling"" which Skousen equates with redistribution ofwealth. But he does not mention the Founders' endorsement of taxing the rich to support the general welfare. ThomasJefferson for example wrote approvingly in 1811 of having federal taxes (then limited to tariffs) fall solely on the wealthywhich meant that ""the farmer will see his government supported his children educated and the face of his country madea paradise by the contributions of the rich alone without his being called on to spend a cent from his earnings.""Skousen also challenges the separation of church and state asserting that ""the Founders were not indulging in any idlegesture when they adopted the motto 'In God We Trust.' ""In reality the motto that came out of the ConstitutionalConvention was ""E Pluribus Unum"": out of many one. ""In God We Trust"" came much later; its use on coins was firstpermitted in 1864 and only in 1955 at the height of the Cold War did Congress mandate that it appear on all currency.The following year President Eisenhowerâwho Welch charged was a Communist agentâapproved ""In God We Trust"" asthe national motto.In 1982 Skousen published a follow-up work an ancestor-worshipping history text titled The Making of America"" andprepared a study guide for nationwide seminars based on its contents. As Alexander Zaitchik reports in his informativestudy of Beck ""Common Nonsense"" the new book became an object of controversy in 1987 after the CaliforniaBicentennial Commission sold it as part of a fund-raising drive. Among its offenses was an account of slavery drawn fromlong-disgraced work by the historian Fred A. Shannon which characterized slave children as ""pickaninnies"" andsuggested that the worst victims of slavery were the slaveholders themselves. The constitutional scholar Jack Rakove ofStanford inspected Skousen's book and seminars and pronounced them ""a joke that no self-respecting scholar wouldthink is worth a warm pitcher of spit.""By the time Skousen died in 2006 he was little remembered outside the ranks of the furthest-right Mormons. Then in2009 Glenn Beck began touting his work: ""The Naked Communist"" ""The Naked Capitalist"" and especially ""The 5000Year Leap"" which he called ""essential to understanding why our Founders built this Republic the way they did."" AfterBeck put the book in the first spot on his required-reading listâand wrote an enthusiastic new introduction for its reissueâit shot to the top of the Amazon best-seller list. In the first half of 2009 it sold more than two hundred and fifty thousandcopies. Local branches of the Tea Party Patriots the United American Tea Party and other groups across the countryhave since organized study groups around it. ""It is time we learn and follow the FREEDOM principles of our FoundingFathers"" a United American Tea Party video declares referring to the principles expounded by Skousen's book. If Beck isthe movement's teacher ""The 5000 Year Leap"" has become its primer with ""The Making of America"" as a kind of 102-level text.The popularity of Beck's broadcasts which now reach two million viewers each day has brought neo-Birchite ideas to anaudience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of. Several times a week Beck informs his audiencethat socialists (whom he also sometimes calls Fascists or Communists) led by Obama have seized power and thatpatriotic Americans must take their country back. His TV show for some time featured ""Comrade Updates"" in which Beckdescribed perfidy while the Soviet anthem played in the background. He attacks all the familiar bogeymen: the FederalReserve System (which he asserts is a private conglomerate unaccountable to the public); the Council on ForeignRelations (born of a ""progressive idea"" to manipulate the media in order to ""let the masses know what should be done"");and a historical procession of evildoers including Skousen's old target Colonel House and Welch's old target WoodrowWilson. His sources on these matters quite apart from Skousen's books can be unreliable. On September 22nd amid adiatribe about House Beck cited a passage from ""Secrets of the Federal Reserve"" by Eustace Mullins. The bookcommissioned in 1948 by Ezra Pound is a startlingly anti-Semitic fantasy of how a Jewish-led conspiracy of all-powerfulbankers established the Federal Reserve in service of their plot to dominate the world.Part of Beck's allure is the promise that he will reveal secret information. In one segment last year he produced a drawingof fascesâwhich he described anachronistically as ""the Roman symbol of Fascism""âand then a picture of an oldMercury dime with fasces on the reverse side. ""Who brought this dime in? It happened in 1916âWoodrow Wilson wasthe President"" he said. ""We've been on the road to Fascism for a while."" Benito Mussolini of course didn't adopt theancient symbol of authority as the Fascist emblem until the nineteen-twenties; the designer of the coin the sculptorAdolph A. Weinman intended it to signify the nation's military preparedness and paired it with an olive branch to illustratethe desire for peace.Beck's readings of Progressive-era politics are nearly as bizarre. Whatever can be said about Theodore Roosevelt hewas not a crypto-radical. It was Roosevelt who coined the term ""lunatic fringe"" to describe the extreme leftists of his dayand his concept of New Nationalismâin which an activist government built a vibrant capitalism partly by regulating bigbusinessâlooked back to Alexander Hamilton not Karl Marx. Nor was Wilson a Bolshevik; in fact in 1917 he sentAmerican troops to Russia to support the anti-Bolshevik White Army. At home his reforms sought to break up monopoliesin order to restore competition among small companies. ""If America is not to have free enterprise"" Wilson declared ""thenshe can have no freedom of any sort whatever.""In 2007 Beck then the host of ""Glenn Beck"" on CNN's Headline News brought to his show a John Birch Societyspokesman named Sam Antonio who warned of a government plot to abolish U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada""and eventually all throughout the Americas."" Beck told Antonio ""When I was growing up the John Birch SocietyâIthought they were a bunch of nuts."" But now he said ""you guys are starting to make more and more sense to me."" Hisguest beamed. ""Yes we at the John Birch Society are not nuts"" Antonio said. ""We are just exposing the truth that's beenout there for many many years."" Since then the Birch Society's Web site has run clips from Beck's Fox broadcastsproudly pointing out similarities with their own ideas. Last June an essay on the site described a presentation by Beck onCommunism in America as ""the ultimate in complete agreement between the Beck and JBS presentations of Americanhistory.""Beck has also praised Ezra Taft Benson one of Skousen's close associates. Benson the Secretary of Agriculture underPresident Eisenhower and the thirteenth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints gained notoriety fora speech in 1966 in which he denounced Democratic officeholders and intellectuals (including the historian Arthur M.Schlesinger Jr.) as socialists and Communist sympathizers warned that ""the Constitution will be endangered and hangas it were by a single thread"" and praised the John Birch Society as ""the most effective non-church organization in ourfight against creeping socialism and Godless Communism."" Last June Beck aired a clip from another Benson speechintoning ""Ezra Taft Benson warned about what was coming."" The Birch Society's Web site subsequently praised Beck for""getting progressively (sorry for the bad word choice) closer to presenting American history in the way that The John BirchSociety has been doing it for over 50 years.""Beck is no more the sole representative of today's multifaceted Tea Party than Welch or Skousen was of the nineteen-sixties far right; he recently told the Times a bit disingenuously that he was ""not involved with the Tea Party."" Why thenhave the politics of Skousen Benson and the John Birch Society had such a resurgence among conservativeRepublicansânot just through Beck but through Tea Party heroes like the Nevada Republican Senate candidate SharronAngle? (Last month Angle gave a warm address to a ""freedom conference"" in Salt Lake City co-sponsored by the JohnBirch Society and Skousen's old group the National Center for Constitutional Studies praising her audience as""mainstream America"" and patriots who had ""heard the call."") The columnist Frank Rich among others has suggestedthat the election of a black President sowed ""fears of disenfranchisement among a dwindling and threatened minority inthe country."" There are signs that this is so: Republicans' singling out of Thurgood Marshall as an ""activist Justice"" duringElena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation hearings the warnings on Fox News about the terrible dangers posed by theminuscule New Black Panther Party. But ""socialist"" is not a racial slur. Jim Crow was not built out of fears of the FederalReserve and the I.R.S. The Tea Party's fulminations against cap-and-trade federal-government bailouts and biggovernment generally play on very old themes that have nothing to do with the color of President Obama's skin.The current right-wing resurgence has more to do with the inner dynamics of American conservatism in the past halfcentury. In the nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties the far right was condemned by liberals as might be expected; inNovember 1961 President Kennedy devoted part of a speech in Los Angeles to denouncing those ""discordant voices ofextremism"" that ""equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state the welfare state with socialism and socialism withCommunism."" But the Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives who feared being perceived asparanoids and conspiracy-mongers.The leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives was William F. Buckley Jr. the editorof National Review. Buckley was by no means moderate in his conservatism. He was a lifelong defender of JosephMcCarthy and a foe of New Deal liberalism. But he drew the line at claiming that the course of American government wasset by a socialist conspiracy and he feared that the ravings of the extreme right would cost more balanced practicalconservatives their chance at national power. ""By 1961"" his biographer John B. Judis writes ""Buckley was beginning toworry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly evenFascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism National Review had promoted."" In the next two decadeswith Buckley's support and counsel Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan completed a conservative revolution thatsucceeded by keeping extremist elements far from the centers of power.As confidant and adviser to leading conservative politicians Buckley had far more political influence than might beexpected from the editor of a weekly journal. Yet in the early nineteen-sixties he found fighting the Birchers and theirfellow-travellers extremely difficult. Even though some of Buckley's colleagues at National Review thought that the BirchSociety went too far they would not attack the society publicly for fear of alienating both the Birchers and theconservatives who sympathized with their views. When Buckley wrote an editorial in 1962 that accused Welch of""distorting reality"" and failing to make ""the crucial moral and political distinction"" between Communists and liberals themagazine immediately lost subscriptions and financial support.By 1960 Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona was emerging as the great political hope of conservative Republicans andhe consulted closely with Buckley. At a meeting at the Breakers hotel in Palm Beach in January 1962 Buckley urgedGoldwater to repudiate the Birch Society. Goldwater demurred; though he conceded that some embarrassing ""kooks""lurked among the Birchers he insisted to Buckley that there were also some ""nice guys"" and that it would be injudiciousto attack the group in public. The Birchers' support helped gain Goldwater the Republican Presidential nomination in1964 and he winked at them in his acceptance speech with his famous line: ""Extremism in the defense of liberty is novice. . . . Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.""In the general election though Goldwater suffered a crushing loss to Lyndon Johnson partly because Democratssucceeded in making him look like a captive of the loony right. (To the Goldwater slogan ""In Your Heart You Know He'sRight"" the Democrats shot back ""In Your Guts You Know He's Nuts."") Buckley's fears had been confirmed. But he wasundeterred in his efforts to build a respectable and viable conservative movement. In 1967 he favored Richard Nixonamong a field of Republican aspirants. He liked Ronald Reagan's politics but considered Reagan who had only recentlybeen elected the governor of California too new to national politics. George Romney the governor of Michigan a wishy-washy moderate was obviously unsuitable to say nothing of the Republican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller of New York.Nixon was a hard-nosed Republican with strong conservative views especially on Communism and the Cold War; he hadestablished himself as a Communist-hunter in the nineteen-forties by pressing the charge that Alger Hiss a former officialat the State Department had spied for the Soviets. And promisingly Nixon was the front-runner. ""It seems to me that weought to have a real chance of winning this year"" Buckley wrote to Goldwater around the time of the Republican NationalConvention. He served the campaign as an adviser and by aiding his friend Frank Shakespeare who had taken chargeof Nixon's media operations.But Buckley's candidate had a reputation for shiftiness that made him unpopular across the political spectrum. Some ofthe editors of National Review recalling that Nixon had cut a deal with Rockefeller in order to secure the G.O.P.nomination in 1960 didn't sufficiently trust him. And the Birch Society had nothing but contempt for the figure whomWelch had called one of ""the slipperiest politicians that ever showed up on the American scene."" As President in 1969Nixon began to open diplomatic relations with Communist China and the right wing placed him on its list of perfidiousappeasers. When he visited Beijing in 1972 even Buckley was deeply offended. But when the general election took placelater that year with the antiwar Democratic candidate George McGovern voicing the country's anxieties over VietnamBuckley and the mainstream of what he called ""responsible conservatism"" returned to Nixon. The purist conservativeswere left to back the third-party candidacy of John Schmitz a Republican congressman and a member of the John BirchSociety.Nixon won in a landslide and the next year he appointed Buckley the American delegate to the United Nations. Theconservative pragmatists had found the way to real power. And despite the embarrassment of Watergate in Nixon'ssecond term their strategy proved effective over time. Nixon's campaign against McGovern sharpened the Democrats'internal divisions over civil rights and Vietnam and Buckley wrote revealed that the Democrats had ""an indifferencetoward national independence and a hostility toward national freedom."" Meanwhile the Buckley mainstream having readthe Birchers out of the conservative movement established itself as a permanent and growing force in the RepublicanParty and in national politics.In 1976 Buckley and National Review supported Ronald Reagan's primary challenge to Nixon's successor Gerald Ford.After two terms as governor Reagan had matured into what Buckley considered a nearly ideal conservative politician: ashrewd leader as well as a man of principle. Reagan nearly succeeded in wresting the nomination from Forddemonstrating how formidable a national figure he had become. The Bircher right had flourished in his political bastion ofOrange County and Reagan was adept at winning extremists' allegiance while he pursued realistic strategies. Hispragmatic side showed immediately after he finally secured the Republican nomination in 1980 when he chose therelatively moderate George H. W. Bush his bitter foe during the primaries as his running mate. Though the decisiondismayed right-wing ideologues it had two practical benefits: it instantly healed the divisions between Republicanmoderates and conservatives and it helped dampen charges from the Democrats that Reagan was a reckless right-winger. Nobody was more pleased by Bush's selection than his fellow Skull and Bones man William F. Buckley whounderstood the political logic as clearly as Reagan had.As President Reagan flattered the extremistsâhe even delivered some admiring words about Skousen's FreemenInstituteâbut he saved his political capital for his real goals: undoing the fiscal underpinnings of New Deal-stylegovernment and redirecting U.S. foreign policy by battling the Soviet Union and its proxies around the world. Heappointed moderates to positions of importance as when he made James Baker III Bush's close associate his first chiefof staff rather than the far more ideological Edwin Meese III his former chief of staff from Califo"

"Here is the Republican former Secretaries of State op ed which ran in today's wash post.The Republican case for ratifying New STARTbn)://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/01/AR2010120104598.html?hpid=topnewsBy Henry A. Kissinger George P. Shultz James A. Baker III Lawrence S. Eagleburger and Colin L. PowellThursday December 2 2010;Republican presidents have long led the crucial fight to protect the United States against nuclear dangers. Thatis why Presidents Richard Nixon Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush negotiated the SALT I START I andSTART II agreements. It is why President George W. Bush negotiated the Moscow Treaty. All four recognizedthat reducing the number of nuclear arms in an open verifiable manner would reduce the risk of nuclearcatastrophe and increase the stability of America's relationship with the Soviet Union and later the RussianFederation. The world is safer today because of the decades-long effort to reduce its supply of nuclear weapons.As a result we urge the Senate to ratify the New START treaty signed by President Obama and RussianPresident Dmitry Medvedev. It is a modest and appropriate continuation of the START I treaty that expiredalmost a year ago. It reduces the number of nuclear weapons that each side deploys while enabling the UnitedStates to maintain a strong nuclear deterrent and preserving the flexibility to deploy those forces as we see fit.Along with our obligation to protect the homeland the United States has responsibilities to allies around theworld. The commander of our nuclear forces has testified that the 1550 warheads allowed under this treaty aresufficient for all our missions - and seven former nuclear commanders agree. The defense secretary thechairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the head of the Missile Defense Agency - all originally appointed by aRepublican president - argue that New START is essential for our national defense.We do not make a recommendation about the exact timing of a Senate ratification vote. That is a matter for theadministration and Senate leaders. The most important thing is to have bipartisan support for the treaty asprevious nuclear arms treaties did.Although each of us had initial questions about New START administration officials have provided reasonableanswers. We believe there are compelling reasons Republicans should support ratification.First the agreement emphasizes verification providing a valuable window into Russia's nuclear arsenal. Sincethe original START expired last December Russia has not been required to provide notifications about changesin its strategic nuclear arsenal and the United States has been unable to conduct on-site inspections. Each dayAmerica's understanding of Russia's arsenal has been degraded and resources have been diverted from nationalsecurity tasks to try to fill the gaps. Our military planners increasingly lack the best possible insight intoRussia's activity with its strategic nuclear arsenal making it more difficult to carry out their nuclear deterrentmission.Second New START preserves our ability to deploy effective missile defenses. The testimonies of our militarycommanders and civilian leaders make clear that the treaty does not limit U.S. missile defense plans. Althoughthe treaty prohibits the conversion of existing launchers for intercontinental and submarine-based ballisticmissiles our military leaders say they do not want to do that because it is more expensive and less effective thanbuilding new ones for defense purposes.Finally the Obama administration has agreed to provide for modernization of the infrastructure essential tomaintaining our nuclear arsenal. Funding these efforts has become part of the negotiations in the ratificationprocess. The administration has put forth a 10-year plan to spend $84 billion on the Energy Department'snuclear weapons complex. Much of the credit for getting the administration to add $14 billion to the originallyproposed $70 billion for modernization goes to Sen. Jon Kyl the Arizona Republican who has been vigilant inthis effort. Implementing this modernization program in a timely fashion would be important in ensuring thatour nuclear arsenal is maintained appropriately over the next decade and beyond.Although the United States needs a strong and reliable nuclear force the chief nuclear danger today comes notfrom Russia but from rogue states such as Iran and North Korea and the potential for nuclear material to fallinto the hands of terrorists. Given those pressing dangers some question why an arms control treaty with Russiamatters. It matters because it is in both parties' interest that there be transparency and stability in their strategicnuclear relationship. It also matters because Russia's cooperation will be needed if we are to make progress inrolling back the Iranian and North Korean programs. Russian help will be needed to continue our work tosecure ""loose nukes"" in Russia and elsewhere. And Russian assistance is needed to improve the situation inAfghanistan a breeding ground for international terrorism.Obviously the United States does not sign arms control agreements just to make friends. Any treaty must beconsidered on its merits. But we have here an agreement that is clearly in our national interest and we shouldconsider the ramifications of not ratifying it.Whenever New START is brought up for debate we encourage all senators to focus on national security. Thereare plenty of opportunities to battle on domestic political issues linked to the future of the American economy.With our country facing the dual threats of unemployment and a growing federal debt bomb we anticipatesignificant conflict between Democrats and Republicans. It is however in the national interest to ratify NewSTART.The writers were secretaries of state for the past five Republican presidents.UnsubscribeThe White House â¢ 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW â¢ Washington DC 20500 â¢ 202-456-1111"

"Dear friend,As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I Believe Everyone will die someday. My name is JAIN HAGIS I am a merchant of Oman Nationality but presently residing in London. I have been diagnosed withOesophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and Right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for Anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the Oman, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to becontended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Eighteen million united state dollars $18,000,000 that I have with finance/Security Company in europe. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatche it to charity organizations. I have set aside 20% for you and for your time.God be with you.mr.

"FROM THE DESK OF:MR XIAO GANG,BANK OF OVERSEAS CHINESETAIPEI,TAIWANDear Friend,How are you today and business in your country? I am Mr.Xiao Gang, Bank Manager,Bank Of Overseas Chinese North Shyn Lin District, Taipei, Taiwan. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. I know you would be wondering why I am writing you with a request such as this but I only urge you to read on.In November 1998, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation, Mr. Mark Kogan, made a Fixed Deposit  of the sum of US$10,000,000.00 (Ten Million United States Dollars) which accumulated  to the sum of US$20,160,176.00 (Twenty Million, One hundred and sixty thousand, One hundred and seventy six United States Dollars for twelve calendar months in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address in America and Britain but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr.Mark Kogan died alongside his wife, from an airplane crash. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; Mr. Mark Kogan died interstate. In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. This sum of US$20,160,176.00 has since been sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.According to the Laws of Republic of China, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Chinese Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose. There is US$20,160,176.00 deposited in my bank, I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless evidence of relationship with the deceased, which I shall provide you with, is presented. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as Bank of overseas chinese is concerned, the bank's management has no single idea of what=92s the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man=92s family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. mark kogan so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. Acting in this capacity really is simple, all you have to do is provide your full names and address so that an attorney here can prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary authentication, approval and a letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer to be done. A bank account in any part of the world that you then provide me with will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiaryext of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share 90/10.I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you.

Rob--pis type this out in BIG print for me. Thx.
"My Lordship,  Calvary greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I am former Mrs. Fatima Abass Yakubu Idris now Mrs Mary Abass Yakubu Idris, a widow to Late Sheik Abass Yakubu Idris. I am 65years old; I am now a new Christian convert,suffering from long time cancer of the breast. From all indications, my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live more than six months, because the cancer stage has gotten to a very Severe stage. My late husband was killed during the Gulf war, and during the period of our marriage we had a son who was also killed in a cold blood during the Gulf war. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death,I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for more than six months and I am so scared about this.  So, I now decided to divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the development of evangelism in Africa,which is in my place,America Europe and Asian Countries.This mission, which will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently relocate to Nigeria, Africa where I live presently.  I selected you and your church after visiting the website for this Purpose and prayed over it, I am willing to donate the sum of $2,200,000.00 Million US Dollars to your Church/Ministry for the development of evangelism and also as aids for the less privileged around you. Please note that, this fund is lying in a Security Company in Europe and the company has branches,therefore my lawyer will file an immediate application for the transfer of the money in the name of your ministry. Please, do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use,than enhancement of evangelism.  Lastly, I want you/your ministry to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition without Jesus Christ in one's life is vanity upon vanity.If you have to die says The Lord, keep fit and I will give you the whole of my life. May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God and the sweet fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you. I awaits your urgent reply. YOURS IN CHRIST, SISTER MARY ABASS IDRIS. CHRIST LOVE MINISTRY, ILORIN, KWARA STATE. ____________________________________________________________Charle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id_section=329"
You were great this morning truly. And your instincts on the speech were just right. I was very proud to be in the frontrow. I am also enormously pleased that in the last 2 months we have gotten a major speech and a Foreign Affairs articledone with a lot of people working very well as a team -- exactly as it ought to be. That is a tribute to top-levelmanagement and our ability to learn from experience and make improvements. It's a team I will be all the more sorry toleave. But now for the QDDR I'll be home for the rest of the week writing hardfile're going to get there -- cheryl taking hold has as usual been a huge help.AM

With regard to the two tops I agree that Lissa's original top was more elegant but Jim thought and Jake and I agreedthat the piece is not as compelling as it could be if we could be clearer about what you actually see coming down theroad that informs your focus on modernizing diplomacy (e.g. you see the proliferation of foundations corporationsngos in the world as an opportunity particularly given that we have more problems to deal with with the samebandwidth so you want to start training people now to do public private partnerships; or you see public opinion assteadily increasing in importance so we have to be doing public engagement in a big way). I tried to do that quickly inthe following graph but w/o being able to draw all the connections.

This is kennedy statement about to go out. Will be joint from u and wjc.Senator Ted Kennedy was one of the most important and influential leaders of our time whose five decades as Senatorfrom Massachusetts helped to shape America's history and chart our shared future. During our time in the WhiteHouse we were thankful for his fierce advocacy and support for universal health care and his work to provide healthcoverage to low-income children. Without his tireless efforts America would not be as close to achieving health carereform as we are today.Continuing the legacy left by his older brothers his lifelong pursuit of civil rights and justice forall moved America forward to form a more perfect union. But beyond his death his legacy of public service will live on inmillions of young people across our nation who now have the chance to serve through the Edward M. Kennedy ServeAmerica Act which will expand AmeriCorps and other youth service opportunities. He loved his country his wife Vickiand his incredible children and grandchildren. We are proud to have known him worked alongside him and called himour friend. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and the people of Massachusetts during this difficult time.

"sbwhoeopSaturday January 9 2010 9:42 AMH: Succinct summary on NI situation at this moment. Details to follow later. SidJanuary 92010The First Lady her young lover and a scandalthat could hand power to Sinn FeinDavid McKittrick reports on the far-reaching consequences ofIris Robinson's infidelityThe mesmerising saga of the toyboy the Northern Ireland First Minister and his straying wife threatened to engulfBelfast's frail political settlement last night.Following a day closeted with advisers Peter Robinson head of the Northern Ireland government broke his silence toinsist defiantly that he would not step down after a day of turmoil. His move is unlikely to stem the clamour for an inquiryinto an affair which has fused the political and the sexual. First indications are that members of his party the DemocraticUnionists (DUP) are reacting to the disclosures with strong disapproval. The party is highly religious and lays heavyemphasis on Christian family values. It is also currently highly nervous that the revelations could cost it seats in thecoming Westminster election. If the DUP were to fracture as a result of the scandal it could lead the way to Sinn Feinbecoming the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly - allowing it to nominate its own first minister and putting thepeace process in jeopardy.Disclosures in a BBC television programme on the activities of his wife Iris who has exited from public life led to a day-long flurry of political calls for inquiries into the Robinson family.Mr Robinson stands accused of failing to notify the authorities that his wife had been involved in financial transactionswithout declaring an interest. She helped a 19-year-old ""toyboy"" lover to set up a business.Mr Robinson said he had asked for the appointment of a senior counsel ""to ask me any questions he or she wishes toask and to give an opinion as to what I should have disclosed or whether I have breached an obligation"".Insisting he had done nothing wrong Mr Robinson accused the BBC of broadcasting ""smears and innuendo"". Saying thathe did not rule out a defamation action he declared: ""I am being tried in the court of public opinion.""Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness who is Deputy First Minister said he was shocked at the BBC revelations and is seekingtalks with both Mr Robinson and Gordon Brown. Mr McGuinness was publicly sympathetic when news of the scandalbroke but his veering towards a tougher line is taken as indicating a calculation that Mr Robinson may not survive thestorm.Mr Robinson who has been First Minister for 18 months is regarded as a pivotal figure in the peace process since hewas prepared to follow the Rev Ian Paisley into government with Sinn Fein.But the state of the political settlement has appeared increasingly rocky as Mr Robinson has resisted pressure fromalmost all points of the political compass to complete devolution by accepting a transfer of responsibility for policing fromLondon to Belfast.His reluctance to move on the policing issue was attributed to nervousness about challenges from hardline opponents inthe Westminster general election. Now opponents are speculating that it might instead have at least partly been due to thefamily scandal which has just become public but which he knew of for months.In recent days Mrs Robinson dramatically announced that she was leaving politics. She is currently Westminster MP foreast Belfast a councillor and a member of the Belfast Assembly. Yesterday there were calls for her to depart immediatelyand stop drawing her salaries.These reflected the fact that while her husband might have a faint chance of political survival her behaviour is regardedas inexcusable.She had been a friend of Kirk McCambley's father Billy. Before he died he asked Mrs Robinson to look after his son. TheBBC programme Spotlight revealed that her relationship with Kirk had developed into a sexual one. It said shesuggested to him that he go into a business venture which was partly organised by Castlereagh council where she is analderman.She is said to have obtained Â£50000 from two property developers to be used to set up the business. She is also said tohave helped approve the McCambley proposal without declaring a financial interest. The council said yesterday it wasinvestigating.The young man was interviewed for the programme. So too was Mrs Robinson's one-time political adviser Selwyn Blacka former Methodist minister who gave the BBC access to 150 text messages allegedly sent to him by Mrs Robinson.Among those calling for a public inquiry yesterday were Jim Allister of Traditional Unionist Voice a hardline critic of MrRobinson. He said the issues in the programme must be addressed ""with utter transparency and candour"".Ulster Unionist leader Sir Reg Empey called for Mrs Robinson's immediate resignation saying: ""It is clear that IrisRobinson's continuing position as an MP Assembly member and councillor is utterly untenable. She should resign all herpositions with immediate effect.""He added: ""It is also unfortunately the case that the office of the First Minister is embroiled in these matters. My party willstudy the events outlined by the BBC and the very serious allegations that have been made with regards to the conduct ofthe First Minister. Inevitably the appropriate authorities will be required to investigate the allegations made against theFirst Minister.""* Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward refused to speculate about Mr Robinson's future.But he said: ""It is a responsibility on everyone in the Assembly to understand that the consequences of allowing thepolitical process to slide would undoubtedly have an impact on the broader canvas.""And that if anybody were to be selfish enough to think this is a moment when that can be allowed to be put in the deepfreeze even some may wish to unpick they would be extremely irresponsible foolish and would be playing very verydangerous games.""Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Woodward said that the First Minister had to be allowed the opportunityto clear his name.But he went on: ""I'm very conscious of the fact that while all that is happening he is First Minister and the business ofdevolution the business of the Executive must go on.""I hope he will be able to resume the responsibilities as First Minister to ensure that the work of the Executive continuesand that includes the talks on policing and justice devolution.""

In my department, I discovered an abandoned sum of US$6,500,000.00 (Six million five hundred thousand united states dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers, who died on 2nd January 2000, along with his entire family as a result of an automobile crash. Since his death none of his relations or next-of-kin has come forward to lay claims for this money as the heir, this is the basically the reason why I have contacted you. We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our operating guidelines. It is upon this discovery I now humbly request your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased, so that the funds can be released in your favor as the beneficiary next of kin. I shall compensate you with 30% of the total sum for your assistance.Please, if this proposal is acceptable by you, kindly get back to me via my private email address provided below and furnish me with your full name, address and telephone number.

"  DEAR FRIEND,   MY GREETINGS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND I HOPE THIS  LETTER MEETS YOU IN GOOD HEALTH. I AM DIAKA TSHOMBE,  AIDE  TO THE LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO OF  ZAIRE NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO  (DRC).  I AM WRITING TO YOU IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON YOUR  PROFILE I RECEIVED FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN  NIGERIA.   I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER IN CONFIDENCE  CONSIDERING MY PRSENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION AS  A  WAR REFUGEE HERE IN NIGERIA. FEW WEEKS BEFORE  THE LATE  PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER,  I WAS  INSTRUCTED BY HIM TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE SUM OF  US$22MILLION WHICH WAS TO BE TRANSFERRED ABROAD AND  LODGED WITH A SECURITY COMPANY FOR SAFEKEEPING  DISCLOSED AS FAMILY VALUABLES IN MY NAME PENDING  FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. TWO WEEKS LATER ON MAY 16  1997,  PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO GAVE UP POWER TO THE  REBELS  LED BY LAURENT KABILA, WHO WERE ADVANCING FROM  KISINGANI AND FLED TO TOGO FROM WHERE HE LATER MOVED  TO MOROCCO WHERE HE DIED ON SEPTEMBER 7, 1997 LESS  THAN FOUR MONTHS AFTER HE WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER.  HE  WAS AGED 66 YEARS. I MANAGED TO ESCAPE TO NIGERIA WITH  MY SON PATRICE, AGED 17 WHERE I AM PRESENTLY  RESIDING AS A  WAR REFUGEE SHORTLY AFTER THE CAPITAL CITY   KINSHASHA WAS OVER RUN OVER BY REBELS. I LOST MY  WIFE  AND MY TWO CHILDREN, AND ALL MY POSSESSIONS DURING  THE  REBEL ONSLAUGHT ON THE CAPITAL CITY.   THE LATE MOBUTU SESE-SEKO DURING HIS 30 YEAR RULE  AMASSED A PERSONAL FORTUNE OF US$8BILLION WITH  HOUSES  IN SWITZERLAND AND FRANCE. HOWEVER, THE INCUMBENT  PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE  SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO  FREEZE ALL HIS ASSETS AND CONFISCATE HIS PROPERTIES.  I  THUS DECIDED TO LIE LOW IN AFRICA TO STUDY THE  SITUATION, UNTIL WHEN THINGS GET BETTER LIKE NOW  THAT  PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA IS DEAD AND HIS SON JOSEPH  KABILA HAS TAKEN OVER.   I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY  ABROAD  WHERE THE MONEY IS STILL LODGED AS FAMILY VALUABLES.  THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM  KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO  INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST ME BY  RECEIVING THE MONEY ON MY BEHALF.

sbwhoeorSunday November 29 2009 1:0S PMHRe: Another memo on backdrop to this week. SidNovember 28 2009EditorialDiplomacy 101We were thrilled when President Obama decided to plunge fully into the Middle East peace effort. He appointed a skilledspecial envoy George Mitchell and demanded that Israel freeze settlements Palestinians crack down on anti-Israelviolence and Arab leaders demonstrate their readiness to reach out to Israel.Nine months later the president's promising peace initiative has unraveled.The Israelis have refused to stop ail building. The Palestinians say that they won't talk to the Israelis until they do andPresident Mahmoud Abbas is so despondent he has threatened to quit. Arab states are refusing to do anything.Mr. Obama's own credibility is so diminished (his approval rating in Israel is 4 percent) that serious negotiations may befarther off than ever.Peacemaking takes strategic skill. But we see no sign that President Obama and Mr. Mitchell were thinking more than onemove down the board. The president went public with his demand for a full freeze on settlements before securing Israel'scommitment. And he and his aides apparently had no plan for what they would do if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahusaid no.Most important they allowed the controversy to obscure the real goal: nudging Israel and the Palestinians into peacetalks. (We don't know exactly what happened but we are told that Mr. Obama relied more on the judgment of his politicaladvisers â specifically his chief of staff Rehm Emanuel -- than of his Mideast specialists.)The idea made sense: have each side do something tangible to prove it was serious about peace and then startnegotiations. But when Mr. Netanyahu refused the total freeze President Obama backed down.Mr. Netanyahu has since offered a compromise 10-month freeze that exempts Jerusalem schools and synagogues andpermits Israel to complete 3000 housing units already under construction. The irony is that while this offer goes beyondwhat past Israeli governments accepted Mr. Obama had called for more. And the Palestinians promptly rejected thecompromise.Washington isn't the only one to blow it. After pushing President Obama to lead the peace effort Arab states especiallySaudi Arabia refused to make any concessions until settlements were halted. Mr. Mitchell was asking them to allow Israelto fly commercial planes through Arab airspace or open a trade office. They have also done far too little to strengthen Mr.Abbas who is a weak leader but is still the best hope for negotiating a peace deal. Ditto for Washington and Israel.All this raises two questions: What has President Obama learned from the experience so he can improve his diplomaticperformance generally? And does he plan to revive the peace talks?The president has no choice but to keep trying. At some point extremists will try to provoke another war. and the absenceof a dialogue will only make things worse. Advancing his own final-status plan for a two-state solution is one high-risk wayforward that we think is worth the gamble. Stalemate is unsustainable.

DEAR Friend,I am the manager of bill and exchange at the auditing of METROPIOLITAN BOND AND FINANCE CO.LTD. in England In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 27.5 Pound sterling (Twenty-Seven  Million-five hundred thousand Pounds sterling) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on Monday, 31 July, 2000 in a plane crash in paris.Please to confirm my story about the crash you can visit this site:http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our financial guidelines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It istherefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release themoney to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement sincenobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The banking and financial law and guide line here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed afterSEVEN years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request offoreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a national here cannot stand as next ofkin to a foreigner.I agree that 40% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision of a foriegn account ,10%will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 50% would be for me Thereafter, I willvisit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable theimmediate transfer of this fund to your country ,you must apply first to our security firm here in London because of financial laws guiding this country,we have moved the money in question to our Security Company Vault here in London for easy transfer of this fund to any where in the world.So i will like you to send tome your NAME,TELEPHONE NUMBER and PHYSICAL ADDRESS for easy and effective communication and location where inthe money is bound to.Upon receipt of your reply, I will get back to you on the next moves to make. I will not fail to bring to your notice that thistransaction is hitch-free and that you should notentertain any atom of fear as all requiredarrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receivethis letter.Trusting to hear from you immediately.Yours Faithfully,MR.CHRIS BARTHOLET."

"Dear Sir,My name is Hartman Onowu,I am the operational managerin account management section incharge of credit andforeign bills of one of the prime banks here in SouthAfrica. I am writing in respect of a foreign customerof my bank who perished with his whole families on25TH JULY,2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [ Flight AF4590 ]with the whole passengers aboard.There is an account opened in this bank in 1998 bythis great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without awritten or oral WILL attatched to the account. Sincehis death , I personally has watched with keeninterest to see the next of kin but all has provedabortive as no one has come to claim his funds and noother person knows about this account or anythingconcerning it,the account has no other beneficiary anduntil his death he was the manager of his company.The total amount involved is 16,000,000.00USD.[Sixteen Million United States Dollar ]. We wishto start the first transfer with $6,000,000.00[Sixmillion] and open successful transaction without anydisappointment from your side, we shall re-apply forthe transfer of the remaining balance to your account.I have secretly discussed this matter with the generalmanager of the bank who I must involve in order tohave a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund toany foreign bank account which you are going tonominate. On this note, I decided to seek for areliable foreigner who will act as the foreignbeneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providinghis/her bank account where the fund will betransferred for immediate investment on any viableproject as no one has come up to be the next of kin.The banking ethics here does not allow such money tostay more than six years without claim hence the moneywill be recalled to the government treasury asunclaimed after this long period of domancy. In viewof this I got your contact through my personal searchto see if you can assist by providing your safe bankaccount for the transfer or find a reliable person whowill be capable of receiving such amount in his or herpersonal account.At the conclussion of the transfer 65% of the fundwill be for me, I will give you 20% of the totaltransfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and inyour country while the remaining 5% will be set asideto settle expenses both parties might incure duringthe transfer process. Upon the receipt of your reply,I will send to you a detailed information about thetransaction.I will not fail to bring to your noticethat this business is 100% risk and trouble free andthat you should not entertain any fear as allmodalities for fund transfer can be finalized within 7to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as thebeneficiary of the fund from the deceased.When you receive this letter, Kindly send me an e-mailor you can call me or fax me. You should also includeyour private fax and phone numbers for easy and safecommunication.TEL:870-763-648313   :870-763-648314.FAX:870-763-648315.

"EMAILjamesnzama012@hotmail.comPHONE:+ 27-833413608NAME :JAMES NZAMAAttention president/ceo.Your contact was made possible by your country's Trade Journal at the World Trade Centre here in Harare, Zimbabwe and I decided to write for assistance. You may be surprised to receive this letter since you do not know me personally,first let me introduce myself,I am Mr.JAMES NZAMA the son of Late Mr. NZAMA KUMALO, who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.My late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers, murdered in cold blood by the special agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by whites.Before his death, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$20.100.000.00 (Twenty Million One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he forsaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a box as a consignment for the Security Company to avoid seizure, and also to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was earnmarked for the purchase of new machinery andchemicals for the farm and establishment for the new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.This land problem arose when president Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the modus operandi adopted by the government, that resulted to rampant killings and mob actions by the war veterans and some political thugs precisely, more than thirty one people(31) have been killed.Heads of government from Western worlds, especially Britain and the USA have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe's plan. Subsequently the South African Development Community (S.A.D.C.) has continuously supported Mugabe's new land reform act. It is against this background that I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa, have decided to transfer my father's money into a foreign account.As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the resposibilty of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could transferred without the knowledge of my government who had tactically frozen our family wealth and the South African government seem to be playing along withthem.I am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in South Africa for fear of seizure and encountering the same experience in the future since both countries have almost the same political history. Moreso, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow suchinvestment since I am an asylum seeker.As a businessman whom I must entrust my future and that of my family on his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk-free. Therefore if you accept to assist us, we are willing to offer you 30% of the total sum for your assistance. 60% will be for my family, while 10%will be fo all expenses.If this proposal is acceptable to you, please send me an email but you should know that this business is highly confidential and shall be kept within yourself.So I will hang on until I hear from you.Best regards,JamesFrom r  Thu Jun  3 14:37:51 2004 with ESMTP id <0HYQ003H0X1L49@mcmmta3.mediacapital.pt> for"

The money is just USD18.Million dollars.

"FROM:Dr.RICHARD SHUBANE .#123CB/PBV,MAIN CITY,JO,BURG, SOUTH AFRICA. Dear Sir, My name is Dr.RICHARD SHUBANE ,I am the operationalmanager in account management section incharge ofcredit and foreign bills of one of the prime bankshere in South Africa. I am writing in respect of aforeign customer of my bank who perished with hiswhole families on 25TH JULY,2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH[ Flight AF4590 ] with the whole passengers aboard.There is an account opened in this bank in 1998 bythis great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without awritten or oral WILL attatched to the account. Sincehis death , I personally has watched with keeninterest to see the next of kin but all has provedabortive as no one has come to claim his funds and noother person knows about this account or anythingconcerning it,the account has no other beneficiary anduntil his death he was the manager of his company.The total amount involved is 106,000,000.00 USD.[ Onehundred and six million United States Dollar ]. Wewish to start the first transfer with$6,000,000.00[Six million] and open successfultransaction without any disappointment from your side,we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remainingbalance to your account.I have secretly discussed this matter with the generalmanager of the bank who I must involve in order tohave a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund toany foreign bank account which you are going tonominate. On this note, I decided to seek for a reliableforeigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary ofthe fund from the deceased by providing his/her bankaccount where the fund will be transferred forimmediate investment on any viable project as no onehas come up to be the next of kin. The banking ethics here does not allow such money tostay more than six years without claim hence the moneywill be recalled to the government treasury asunclaimed after this long period of domancy. In viewof this I got your contact through my personal searchto see if you can assist by providing your safe bankaccount for the transfer or find a reliable person whowill be capable of receiving such amount in his or herpersonal account.At the conclussion of the transfer 65% of the fundwill be for me, I will give you 20% of the totaltransfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and inyour country while the remaining 5% will be set asideto settle expenses both parties might incure duringthe transfer process.Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you adetailed information about the transaction.I will notfail to bring to your notice that this business is100% risk and trouble free and that you should notentertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfercan be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after youapply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund fromthe deceased. When you receive this letter.Kindly send me an e-mail MY PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS~:auditorotto2@netscape.net  You should also includeyour private fax and phone numbers for easy and safecommunication.Respectfully yours,Dr.RICHARD SHUBANE__________________________________Do you Yahoo!?Yahoo!

"to draw your attention to US$35.8 Million (Thirty-fiveMillion Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).I deposited the box containing the fund in a securitycompany in Johannesburg, South Africa as valuables.During the war, I was very committed and dedicated inwinning the war against the rebels, until I found outthat the senior army officers and governmentfunctionaries were busy helping themselves withgovernment funds and properties, sending them toforeign countries. Due to this, when the formeradviser to the president and I were assigned by thepresident (JOSE EDUARDO SANTOS) to purchase arms inSouth Africa, we saw this as a golden opportunity anddiverted the money and share it, of which I got atotal sum of US$35.8 Million (Thirty-five MillionEight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Incase of my absence on earth as a result of death, onlyyou should solicit for assistance of a reliable andsincere foreign partner to assist you to transfer thismoney out of South Africa for investment purpose. Ideposited the box in your name and you can claim italone with deposited code. Your mother is with allthe documents. Take good care of your mother and yoursisters.>From this words of my late father, you can understandthat life and future of my family depend on this fund,as such I will be grateful if you can assist us. Weare now living in South Africa as political asylumseekers. Financial laws and regulations of theRepublic of South Africa do not permit us certainfinancial rights.

"Atten:Nadkov. Dear Sir/Madam, You may be surprise to receive this letter from me as you don't know me in person, but please take this mail into consideration. I am Mr. Nicholas Kular, the son of   late Mr. JOHNSON KULAR, who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. Kindly work with me to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you, my late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority. Before his death, he had earlier taken  to South Africa the sum of US$ 26.5 Million (Twenty -Six Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)  which he deposited with a Security Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a box as VALUABLES AND PERSONAL EFFECTS to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was for purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the ""modus operandi"" adopted by the government. This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs. Precisely, More than thirty-eight (38) people have so far been killed. Heads of governments from the west, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe'splan. Subsequently, South African Development Community (S.A.D.C) has continuously supported Mugabe's new land act, it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father's money into a foreign account. As the eldest son of my Father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing  our family wealth and South Africa's government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history. More so, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an ""ASYLUM"". As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk-free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter. For your assistance, we are offering you 20% of the total sum, 75% for me and my family while 5% will be mapped out for any expenses we may be incured during the course of this transaction. We wish to invest our part of the money on commercial property based on your advice. Finally, all i want from you is assurance that you will not betray my trust. If this appeal  is acceptable to you, please confirm your interest via the above telephone number or better still email. Best Regards. Mr.Nicholas Kular (For the Family). "

"99 35<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Dear Sir/Madam,<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I am the expert director heading Investments and Portfolio Management in the above-mentioned firm in Switerland.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I am contacting you in view of an urgent assistance to carry out a pending transaction, which will develop a cordial business relationship between you and me. One of my clients whom I have personally managed his portfolio for 10 years now was a victim of a fatal car crash. His name is Late Mr Saud Ed Abad AlKharj, he was survived by a fiance and a two-year-old son from her as they intended getting married but where trying to be cautious because of Islamic law attitude on adultery. This were his only family and no next of kin, as he was the only child of Late Sheikh Hamza Al Kharj Al Faisal, who received royalties from the Kuwaiti Government on one of his fields which oil was discovered and subsequently explored (the Al Jazriah Oil Field).<BR>&nbsp;<BR>All subsequent investigation to find a next of kin was privately conducted by me and was futile. It was at this juncture that I and other officials Managing his portfolio and 2 bank managers where he had his accounts now <BR>decided to make this proposal and transfer ownership of the portfolio to an Agreeing party as beneficiary to the portfolio of the deceased.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The reason why ownership cannot be transferred to his wife to be and only son is that Islamic law will not recognize such and if an attempt is made on that it may put her in trouble with the authorities for giving birth outside <BR>marriage. So we have decided to help her by making this proposal and making sure she gets a substantial part of Late Mr Saud Alkharjï¿½s property for her <BR>and her son.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>You must be asking where I got your mail address, it was made available to me by a junior director Mrs Cynthia Philips in charge of customer services on request for contacts for investment expansion for a client but she is not aware of this contact. All records and accounts regarding the assets of deceased were managed by me for 10 years running, if you are interested to assist us, all I will do is to incorporate in the old records recognizing <BR>you as the only beneficiary.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The banking law here stipulates that if such portfolio remains unclaimed after four years it will go to the public department. The need for a foreigner as beneficiary is occasioned by the fact that the deceased was not <BR>permanently resident in Switzerland.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>For your assistance, we made up of I, 2 senior directors in my firm and 2 bank managers in banks which the Kuwaiti Government pay royalties, accruing to the deceased have agreed in fairness to make available 25% of all bank <BR>funds cleared and 15% of the royalties which you will continue to receive on behalf of the deceased as sole beneficiary every year. However we do not intend to share any interest with you as far as the estates and property are <BR>concerned, as they will be going to the surviving wife and child.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>If you are okay with the above explanations, you may reply us including all your contact telephone and fax numbers so that we may confirm you genuine, after which we will make more information available to you on how we will <BR>proceed.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I must further assure you that this transaction is 100% legitimate and the modalities for this transaction is being handled by top executives which assure a risk free transaction.Kindly visit my firms website at <A href=""http://www.royaltrust.com"">www.royaltrust.com</A>.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>We await your timely response.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Best Regards<BR>&nbsp;<BR>DR PETER CLAPTON<BR></BODY></HTML>--= Multipart Boundary 1030031738--"

See below. Terrific piece from the BBC which I will circulate.Meant to mention yesterday that I am going to Buenos Aires Montevideo and Santiago next week. In Buenos Aires andMontevideo I will speaking at two business conferences being hosted by Council of the Americas and in Chile I will bevisiting some of the public diplomacy programs we launched after the earthquake.You may recall that I have a long-standing relationship with Christina Kirchner going back to my Discovery days. We hadquite a large and successful business there. We are trying to arrange for me to meet with her when I am in BAand Arturo has briefed me on points he would like me to make if I get to spend some time with her.I thought yesterday went well although I think it is going to be hard going to keep the world interested and committedto raising the necessary funding.im
Ok. Let me know how it unfolds.
"Telephone:+229 97 98 99 63.Due to your good nature with others,I want to propose a very interesting deal to you.I work with Deposit Trust House,a Security and Trust company in Republic of Benin,West Africa,as the operations manager.Actually,there is one very big customer of our company,he is an american by name Elijah Miller,he had $252,000,000.00(two hundred and fifty two million)united states dollars with our company and I was his representative in our company.Last three months he came and collected $2,000,000.00(two million dollars)cash and said if he arrives in his country he was going to send us his banking details,so that we can remit his remaining balance of $250,000,000.00.But I have not heard from him since then.Just three weeks ago his secretary that he came with to our company,called me and said Mr. Elijah had instructed her to send me the bank account were we are to remit the remaining $250million,because he(elijah) was sick.She sent me all the necessary confidential documents and said Elijah gave it to her,so there was nothing we could do but to start remittance of the fund bit by bit.But before we started remitting the money,I called Elijah's line and his wife picked up the phone and to my greatest surprise,she said Elijah had died in a car crash a month ago.That was when I understood that the secretary must have stolen all those documents from his office vault immediately he died and she is now claiming the funds on his behalf,but I kept quite so that I can also get my share.I have made a perfect plan with the remittance director,who is my only partner in this deal because of his position.We are crediting the account she sent with just $2.5million per week,with the excuse that the government will not allow more than that to go out per week.Which is a lie to slow down the remittance so that we can get someone to use in making claims also.What we want you to do now is to supply us your banking details so that we can credit your account as elijah's partner and you can take 25% of the total amount credited to your account and give us the rest as our share.Please consider this proposal quickly and reach me immediately with your answer,because time is not on our side.I am waiting,Yours TrulyEngineer George Egobia.

"Engr.Makalele Johnson.PretoriaSouth Africa.FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION. It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf ofmy colleagues. I got your information from a personal search in theinternet business index. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operationwith you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit ofall parties, and hopeyou will keep it confidential because of the nature ofthis business.Within the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources where I workas a Director of Project Implementation, and with co-operationof four other top officials, we have in our possession, an overduepayment in US funds. The said funds represent certain percentageof the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by aforeign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoicedto the amount of US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million Five HundredThousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract costhas been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed. Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreigncontractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relationswith foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies.As a result we included ours bills for approvals with the co-operationof some officials at the Department of Finance and the ReserveBank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance asthe beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowedto operate a foreign account. I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that,should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your shareas compensation will be 25% while my colleagues and I receive 70%, andthe balance of 5% for taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred.It does not matter whether or not your company does contractprojects of the nature described here.

With your approval we'll put out.DRAFT STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTONUrging Iran to Respect the Fundamental Freedoms of its CitizensThe United States is deeply concerned that Iran continues to deny its citizens their civil rights as well as to intimidateand detain those Iranians who seek to hold their government accountable and who stand up for the rights of theirfellow citizens. We remain troubled by the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani who garnered international attentionfor her verdict of death by stoning. While the Iranian government later stated she would not face execution by stoningher fate has been left unclear. We are also troubled by reports that Ebrahim Hamidi an 18-year old charged withhomosexuality faces imminent execution despite the fact that he is currently without legal representation. Neither oftheir cases have proceeded with the transparency or due process enshrined in Iran's own constitution and their lawyerMohammad Mostafaei felt that he had no other choice than to flee Iran after he had been questioned by authoritiesand his family members had been detained.We are also concerned about the fate of Iranians who are in danger of imminent execution for exercising their right tofree expression after the June 2009 elections including Jafar Kazemi Mohammad Haj Aghaei and Javad Lan.The United States urges the Iranian government to halt these executions in accordance with its international obligationsto the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and calls for the immediate release of all political prisonersand imprisoned human rights defenders. The United States will continue to stand with people all around the world whoseek to exercise their universal rights and to speak out in defense of human liberties.

"MR. CHEUNG PUIHANG SENG BANK LTD.DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,CENTRAL HONG KONG,HONG KONG. Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Cheung Pui director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have an urgent business suggestion for you.I honestly apologize and hope I do not cause you much embarrassment by contacting you through this means for a transaction of this magnitude,but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.Furthermore,due to this issue on my hands now,it became necesary for me to seek your assistance, and it is imperative for me to know your opinionBefore the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Bassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 5 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem  so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning thisissue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incure during the transaction. Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me via my private box, {che_Pui67@yahoo.com.hk} and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind Regards,Mr Cheung Pui.___________________________________________________________________________Mail envoyï¿½ par le service WebMail du Site PHP-Nuke- http://www.forcetacticalarmy.com"

"Dear Sir,I am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistanceto each other likewise developing a cordial business relationship. As I am interested in your kind of business and wishing to invest in your country.I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha, wife to the late Nigerian military Head of State. General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998 still in office duetoa protracted illness.I believe you must be aware of the recent face-off between my family and the present Civilian Government of President Olusegun Obasanjo who wants all my Late husbands foreign bank accounts and assets confiscated because of the monetary excesses of my late husbandsMilitary regime.Currently, within my reach is the sum of twenty-three Million seven Hundred thousand United States Dollars (US$ 23,700,000.00) cash, which I intend touse for investment purposes especially in your country. This huge sum of money came as result of a payback contractdeal between my late husband and a Russian firm on our country's Multibillion Dollar Ajaokuta Steel plant/complex. The Russian partners had sincereturned my husband's share of US$23.7Million after his death and lodged it with a security firm.Right now the new Civilian Government have revoked all our licenses thatallows us to own financial and oil companies and has frozen some of my latehusbands bank account in Switzerland and America.In view of these I acted very fast to withdraw this US$23.7M from thesecurity company's vault well preserved and packaged in {1}trunk box and lodged in a private security firm OVERSEAS as Family Deposits (FD) No record everexisted concerning the moneyneither is the money traceable by the Government because there is nodocuments showing that we received the money from the Russians.However, due to the current situation in the country concerning the present civilian Government hostile attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of the money within the country. Thus I seek your assistance in moving this family Deposits (FD) into your account for safekeeping pending myarrival in your country for investment purposes.On your consent, I shall provide you with a POWER OF ATTORNEY to collectthis deposit with the security company OVERSEAS on our behalf. Bearing in mindthat your assistance is needed in this regards, I propose a commission of 20% (TWENTY PERCENT) of thetotal sum to you for the expected services and 10% for local andinternational expenses if any.Your urgent response is highly needed so as to start further contact .I therefore mandate Barrister GREG ADO who is our family Attorney to deal with you through out this transaction on my behalf.May I at this point, emphasize the high level of confidentiality which this business demands whatever your decision and hope you will not betray thetrust and confidence which I repose in you.Please don't forget to indicate your convenient phone and fax number wherewe can always contact you.However, you may need to give me sufficient assurance that you will not siton this fund when it is finally remitted into your account. Please direct your reply of this mail to my family attorney,GREG ADO at gregado@rxpost.net anddiscuss withhim towards effective completion of this transaction.I believe I can trust you and I am willing to accept from you any useful and profitable investment proposal advice in your country. or reply me if my proposal interest you through my alternative email address:mcabacha@gawab.coms.Remain blessed.Best wishes,Mrs. Maryam Abacha.----------------------------------------------------------------Ce service de mailing vous est offert par http://www.freesurf.fr.FreeSurf, votre acces ADSL a partir de 29 euros/moishttp://www.freesurf.fr/adsl/"

"Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we can not release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you,so that the money can be release to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody will come for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed dormant fund.The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after eight years the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed dormant fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe like me can not stand as next of kin to a foreigner.I agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision of a foriegn account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me.Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin to the deceased customer with a text of application that i will send to you,but before i send to you the text of application form,I will like you to send me the following informatios1.NAME IN FULL:................................2.ADDRESS:.......................................3.NATIONALITY:...................................4.AGE:.............................................5.Sex..............................................6.OCCUPATION:......................................7.MARITAL STATUS:..................................8.PRIAVTE PHONE NO............................................9.PRIVATE FAX NO:.............................................so i will like you to send to me those informations for easy and effective communication.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application form.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter,if only you are intrested and ready to help.Trusting to hear from you immediately.Yours Faithfully,DR...ADAMU  ISMALERMANAGER AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENTBANK OF AFRICA"

I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. We had a foreign client named Mr. Wooin Shim, whodeposited a huge sum of money (12.5 Million United States Dollars), with our bank.Eventually, this client died in a plane crash and since his death we have not had anybody come up for theclaims as the next of kin.You may want to take a look at other passangers who were on the same plane, here is a site for your perusal.http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.list/A situation I have monitored closely with my position in the bank. Now having monitored this deposit andmanaged it over the years before his death, and hence nobody has showed up as the next of kin for the pastyears. I now solicit for your assistance to present you as the next of kin as every other arrangement has beenconcluded by me and my partners involved. I am only waiting for a foreigner to enable us move the funds to his or heraccount. This does not have any risk attached to it, as we haveour contacts in various departments of the bank that will handle all the internal documentations.I therefore request you to confirm your interest by areturn message through my email and I will furnish you with details and more information.Best regardsMIKE KUTI_________________________________________________"
Big change of plans in the Senate. Senator Reid just announced that he was no longer going to move forward with theomnibus appropriations bill. Instead he filed cloture motions on the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell and the DREAMAct.Those petitions will ripen on Saturday. So it looks like the Senate will be again considering the new START Treatytomorrow. We should know the starting time shortly.

After further back and forth we've come up with a way to mention Ramat Shlomo and incitement to violence thatshould be acceptable to both sides. The additional paragraph would read:We have urged the parties to help create an atmosphere that is conducive to successful talks and they are respondingincluding President Abbas' statement that he will work against incitement of any sort and Prime Minister Netanyahu'sstatement that there will be no construction at the Ramat Shlomo project for two years. They are both trying to moveforward in difficult circumstances and we commend them for that.
"Dear Sir/MadamCompliment of the day to you .I got your contact through a friend, who attended a programme in 2005,S.P.E.Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, in searching for a reliable andtrust worthy person to handle risk free transaction.He recommended you to me.=I am Mr.Mustapha Momodu, Account Manager of Standard Chartered Bank Kanashie =Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On =December 29th2002, an American contractor with the Government of Ghana, Mr. Michael Creekmade a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued atTWENTY TWO Million,Four hundred thousand dollars ($22.4million) in mybranch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwardingaddress but got no reply.After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from hiscontract employers, that Mr. Michael Creek died from an automobile accident.On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and allattempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made furtherinvestigation and discovered that Mr. Michael Creek did not declare any nextof kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork.This sum of $22.4million is still sitting in Standard Chartered Bank and theinterest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. =No one will come forward to claim it.According to the laws of the country, at the expiration of 5 (five) years,the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody appliesto claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you toassist me fully as foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Michaelcreek, so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into thehands of some corrupt officials.This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your fullnames and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documentsand affidavites, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shallemploy the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of theWILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administrationin your favor for the transfer.A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will thenfacilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiaryext of kin.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60%for me and 30% for you while 10% will be set aside for miscellaneousexpenses. There is no risk involved in this transaction, as every necessarypaperwork for this fund, will be done and my position as the Branch Managerguarantees the successful execution of this transaction.Hope this mail will meet your perfect understanding.Best Regards.Mr.Mustapha Momodu  --36c3cac6-f322-404a-9058-1e6db6ebf8a3--"

"Holbrooke's Contributions on Af/PakHolbrooke has assembled an unprecedented interagency team to carry out the work onAf/Pak â a whole-of-government team in DC and a reorganized and reenergized U.S.mission in Kabul.Holbrooke's team is actually getting things done including the implementation of morethan 20 detailed action plans. Some examples of the work thus far:â¢ The civilian surge in Afghanistan is on pace to meet targets by end of year.â¢ Our approach to assistance in Afghanistan has changed dramatically both through theconsolidation of efforts under Tony Wayne and the review (and sometimes rejection) ofassistance contracts.â¢â¢ Holbrooke has opened and is actively pursuing R/R channels.â¢ The swift and comprehensive U.S. response helped alleviate and reduce the impact of theSwat refugee crisis.â¢â¢ The trilateral meetings have helped create conditions for progress on key cross-borderissues.)11â¢ Holbrooke's international diplomacy â in the Gulf with China with the cadre of otherspecial representatives â has translated into funding and equipment commitments morebuy-in and more patience.Holbrooke has been a key driver of (non-military) strategic innovation in Afghanistan andPakistan. Here are some examples:IllDefining a regional approach to Af/Pak (including trilateral summits)â¢ The regional approach championed by Holbrooke became a central feature of the Reidelreport; the trilats are a pure Holbrooke inventionAfghanistanThe clearest voice and thinker on swifter and more heavily resourced ""Afghanization"" -primarily by standing up a sufficiently large and sufficiently capable ANSF â as the preferablealternative to adding more troops.â¢ The Reidel report calls for training 134000 army and 82000 police over two years;Holbrooke is working through a strategy that would more than double those numbers andspeed the pace of training. Such a strategy has to resolve significant obstaclesparticularly with respect to the police.Framing and executing the U.S. approach to Afghan elections:â¢Developing a strategy â in partnership with the Afghan government and others â for pursuingreconciliation/reintegration.â¢ The Reidel report discusses support for the Afghan government's efforts to reintegrate""non ideologically-committed"" insurgents who lay down their arms renounce al Qaedaand accept the Afghan Constitution. Holbrooke was key in developing this aspect of thereport and is now working through the next phases.Prioritizing a shift in emphasis on counternarcotics from eradication to interdictionâ¢ The Reidel report discusses the need for increased interdiction efforts â and the attendantneed to support licit agriculture to shift livelihoods.Emphasizing and executing our engagement with Arab allies China and Turkeyâ¢ The Reidel report speaks generally about engaging all those with a stake in the region. Itdoes not lay out a specific diplomatic strategy or priority countries.â¢ [NOTE:â¢ This issue does not get extensive treatment in the Reidel report.Pakistanâ¢ The Reidel report does not speak in any detail to this issue.Responding decisively to the refugee crisis in Swat and Bunerâ¢ Obviously the Reidel report does not address this. The immediate response to therefugee crisis was Holbrooke's team at its finest.Making the image of the United States in Pakistan as a critical strategic priorityâ¢ The Reidel report focuses on strategic communications in Afghanistan. Holbrooke'srecent trip with Judith McHale is the latest in an ongoing effort to develop a strategiccommunications plan for Pakistan. Generally Holbrooke along with McDonough hasbeen the key mover on all things related to strategic communications in both Afghanistanand Pakistan; he has a good sense of what is missing and what is needed.Pursuing a major new energy initiative to address Pakistan's economic troubles and boostsupport for the United Statesâ¢ The Reidel report mentions energy as a key sector where we should be encouragingforeign investment.1.

From all indications my condition is really deteriorating and it's quite obvious that I won't live more than 2 months according to my doctors. This is because the cancer stage has gotten to a very bad stage.   My late husband died early last year from heart attack, and during the period of our marriage we couldn't produce any child. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death,I inherited all his business  and wealth.The doctor has advised me that I will not live for more than 2 months, so I have now decided to spread all my wealth, to contribute mainly to the development of charity in Africa, America, Asia and Europe. Before my late husband died he was a major oil tycoon, in dubai and deposited the sum of 20 million dollars (Twenty million dollars) in a security company in europe some years ago,thats all i have left now,i need you to collect this funds  and distribute it yourself to charity. so that when i die my soul can rest in peace. the funds will be entirely in hands and management. I pray God gives you the wisdom to touch very many lives,that is my main concern.  20% of this money will be for your time and effort, while 80% goes to charity. God bless you. Mrs. Maryam Ibrahim."

Now I now why Huma has been at a computer all day clicking the mouse incessantly
"Permit me to first of all introduce myself. My name is Kenneth.c. Ndlovu, the eldest child of Mr Tarcisious Ndlovu from Zimbabwe.         During the current crisis against the farmers of Zimbabwe by the supporters> of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his party members > and their followers.My father was one of the best farmers in the country and> knowing that he did not support the president's> political ideology, the president's supporters invaded my father's farm burnt down everything, killed him and confiscated all his investments.        After the death of my father, my mother and I with my younger sister decided to move out of Zimbabwe for the safety of our lives. Before we moved, we were able to, with the assistance of a diplomat friend of my late father send the money> my father kept in the safe in my mother's house, which amounted to the sum of US$24.7 Million United States Dollars to Overseas. The diplomat, my father?s friend assited us in sending the money via Diplomatic courier. The funds are presently being kept away in the secret vaults of a private security firm based in overseas The officials of the firm are also not aware of the contents of the package and are of the belief that they are helping me in keeping my personal Valuables, because> of the way I packaged the consignment as family valuables. Myself and my mother then decided to contact any reliable overseas Partner who could assist us to collect and transfer this money out of the Security company to a safe account nominated by such a person, because we as asylum seekers here  in South Africa we are handicapped in doing this because our status here does not permit us to a lot of facilities. If my proposition is considered, for assisting us in this transaction, we intend to share funds in the ratio of 75% for me and my family, 20% for you then 5% will be set aside to cover any expenses incurred during this transaction. There is no risk at all, as all the documents for the success of this transaction I will forward to you. If you are interested, please reply immediately to this.kenc1962@mail.nu  Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant  documents that will help you understand. Please observe utmost confidentiality,  and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.  You can also visit the sites below to give you an insight of the injustice done to white farmers in my country. http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2787057.stm http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2571697.stm Awaiting your urgent reply Thanks and regards Kenneth .c.

""This is a one simple way to fix that.""The Beltway rumor mill often includes gossip that Steinberg isn't happy or that he's not seen as an integral part ofPresident Obama's foreign policy team or that his efforts aren't appreciated.Reines who rarely speaks on the record responded to a question about whether Steinberg is indeed unhappy in thisway: ""I'm not a shrink and I have to confess that we don't sit around in a circle often enough exploring our feelings. Butwhat is crystal clear to everyone is that Jim is smart dedicated and valued.""Steinberg has a been a principal adviser on issues ranging from Iran -- he is the administration's team lead cybersecurityand China (he's been tasked with pressuring China into accepting tougher sanctions on Iran) but his work often goesunnoticed.On Friday he is said to have given a tongue-lashing to the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren about thatcountry's actions during a visit by Vice President Biden.When President Obama selected Gen.

FYI
"Council on Foreign RelationsExpert BriefThe U.S.-China Economic Relationship: Separating Facts from MythsSteven Dunaway Adjunct Senior Fellow for International EconomicsAuthor:Former deputy director of the Asia and Pacific department at the International Monetary Fund. Authorof the Council Special Report Global Imbalances and the Financial Crisis.November 16 2009http://www.cfr.org/publication/20757/uschina_economic_relationship.html?breadcrumb=Â°/02Fregion%2F271%2FchinaMany myths surround the economic relationship between the United States and China. Four in particular stand out andit is important to identify them as myths to avoid misunderstandings that could adversely influence policy decisions. Thefact that China has become the largest foreign holder of U.S. government securities is taken as indicating that the UnitedStates is heavily dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. Similarly since China is a major source for U.S.imports U.S. consumers are seen as dependent on cheap Chinese goods. In addition the Chinese authorities haveemphasized that they strongly resist external pressures to try to influence policy decisions and that economic instability inChina is bad with adverse implications for the rest of the world.Taken together these four myths could lead to the conclusion that China should not be pushed hard by the United States(or other major countries) to more quickly change its policies especially its exchange rate policy to facilitate therebalancing of its economy. But such a conclusion would be a major mistake and that is why during his trip to AsiaPresident Barack Obama needs to dispel these myths and bring pressure to bear for faster economic policy changes inChina. This would be in keeping with the objectives for dealing with global imbalances laid out by the G-20 summit inPittsburgh in September 2009.Myth No. 1: Washington has limited leverage because China is the main ""banker"" for the United StatesChina holds a large amount of U.S. government securities. Of China's $2.3 trillion in official reserves it is estimated that70 percent is held in U.S. dollar assets. China is a big customer for U.S. debt but it is not America's banker. Nor is theUnited States dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. If China elects not to buy U.S. Treasuries there are otherwilling public and private sector buyers as indicated by the strong demand for these securities worldwide. Although theU.S. government might have to pay higher interest rates as an incentive to get other investors to buy Treasuries in theevent that the Chinese reduce their demand the increase in interest rates would likely be small.Major consequences from a decision by China to reduce its purchases of U.S. Treasury securities would depend on thereason behind the decision. It would be in China's best interest (and beneficial for the rest of the world as well) if Chinareduced its purchases of U.S. Treasuries because it decided to stop heavily managing its exchange rate and allow greaterflexibility in the currency's movements. This is an important policy change that is required if China is going to rebalance itseconomy and be able to sustain rapid growth.China is a big customer for U.S. debt but it is not America's banker. Nor is the United States dependent on China tofinance its budget deficits.If instead China continues to heavily manage its exchange rate it will build up large additional amounts of officialreserves. If it decides to hold less of these additional reserves in U.S. Treasury securities then China will increase itspurchases of assets denominated in other currencies with euro-denominated securities being the most likely alternative.In these circumstances China would continue to intervene in its exchange market with the central bank buying U.S.dollars for Chinese renminbi and then selling dollars for euro to acquire European assets. The result would be anappreciation of the euro. Consequently countries in Europe not the United States would probably be most affected byChina's move because the negative impact of euro appreciation on European economic activity would likely far outweighthe effects on the United States of smaller Chinese purchases of Treasuries.Alternatively China could choose to start dumping its stock of U.S. securities. The result would be appreciation of othermajor currencies (depending on where China would decide to park its reserve assets); upward pressure on U.S. interestrates; and the possibility of financial market disruptions if China dumped its U.S. dollar assets rapidly. However the U.S.Federal Reserve could limit the rise in U.S. interest rates and would be able to ensure adequate liquidity to prevent marketdisruptions. But a decision to dump Treasuries would have a large effect on China itself. The country would incur asubstantial capital loss on its reserve assets. The Chinese authorities are deeply concerned about such a loss and arevery unlikely to decide to dump U.S. assets. In fact the discussion initiated by China regarding the need for an alternativeofficial reserve asset is motivated by its concerns about potential losses on its U.S. dollar holdings.Myth No. 2: The United States is heavily dependent on cheap Chinese goodsThis is not really true. Only roughly 15 percent of U.S. imports come from China. Moreover all of the basic types ofmanufactured consumer goods that China exports to the United States (clothing textiles footwear toys small appliancesetc.) can be imported from other countries or could be produced domestically. The prices for goods that could substitutefor products from China would be higher but the difference in costs would be relatively small. Competition amongproducers has become fiercer and as a result cost differentials between goods from China and other suppliers arenarrowing.Dependence actually runs the other way. China is highly dependent on U.S. demand for its products. Economic growth inChina is heavily dependent on exports. Although China has been able to achieve its 8 percent GDP growth target in 2009owing to the stimulus to domestic demand provided by government policy actions the country will struggle to meet thisobjective in 2010 and succeeding years if demand for its exports in the United States does not pick up.Myth No. 3: External pressure on China for policy changes is counterproductive.The Chinese authorities stress that in the face of external pressure they tend to strongly resist economic policy changes.The Chinese have in particular used this argument to try to fend off pressures for appreciation of the exchange rate. Whileno country wants to appear to be weak and susceptible to external pressure the truth is that if there is no pressure thereis less incentive to change policy. This is especially true in China where the authorities are wedded to the status quobecause of past success and inclined to make only gradual changes to economic policies. Recent developments inChina's exchange rate illustrate this point. In the absence of external pressure since August 2008 China has reverted tofixing its exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar.Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis changes in China's policies are likely tobe delayed and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world.Myth No. 4: Instability is bad for ChinaChinese authorities also have suggested that instability in China is bad for the rest of the world because of adverse effectson China's growth rate. But instability (or the fear of instability) has played a big role in initiating economic policy changesin China. For example concern about instability arising from the growing gap between urban and rural incomes has beena major factor behind new initiatives to develop China's interior (such as the Develop the West program) and to improveconditions and opportunities for the rural population (including breaking down restrictions and discriminatory treatment ofmigrant workers). Hence for China instability is not necessarily bad but it is a problem for the authorities. Instability inChina also is not necessarily bad for the rest of the world because of its effect on China's growth. Although Chinaaccounts for a significant portion of world GDP growth the country does not generate much demand for products fromother countries given China's large trade and current account surpluses. Some countries in Asia and commodityproducers may be benefiting from China's strong growth but overall it is not providing much stimulus for the worldeconomy as a whole so slower growth in China will have little effect on economic activity in the rest of the world.It is important for President Obama to separate fact from myth in his economic policy discussions with the Chineseauthorities during this trip to Asia to build a sounder relationship. The president should not shy away from pushing theChinese hard on economic reform and rebalancing of China's economy but this should be done in his private discussionswith China's senior leaders. Multilateral discussions such as those in the context of the G-20 process are a much moreeffective forum for the United States to take a public stance on China's economic policies jointly with other majoreconomies.Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis changes in China's policies are likely tobe delayed and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world. It also is not in the bestinterest of China because without a shift away from heavy dependence on investment and exports to drive growth towardgreater reliance on consumption China will not be able to sustain rapid economic growth and development. Getting Chinato fully realize this and to act more quickly than the authorities are inclined to do is a considerable task for the UnitedStates and other major economies."

I am writing you this letter based on the latest development at my bank, which I will like to bring to your personal edification. I am writing you this letter with so much joy and excitement even though my heart goes out to the very powerfuland distinguished gentleman who I was fortunate to have worked for and extremely privileged to have known for numerous years.I am a top official in charge of client accounts in EQUITABLE PCI BANK inside the Philippines.In 2001, my client was going through a horrendous divorce in the United States Of America and Was on the verge of losing most of his estate to his vicious and diabolical wife. As a result of this alarming predicament, my client came to me with a very brilliant idea. He transferred some funds, ten million two hundred thousand dollars($10.2m) to a fixed deposit account in my bank under an alias which only the two of us knew about as the confidentiality of the matter was necessary for his protection.Due to his untimely death in early 2002, the funds have been sitting in the account ever since and will continue to do so perpetually unless we do something about it. This is where you come in. I located you through an agency that helps seek people by their email.My client did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paperwork of his bank deposit. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I would like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to our client so that you will be able to receive his funds. I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we can come out successful.I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to my client. All that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full "

"<HTML><BODY>My dear friend, <br><br>I am DR. Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria,Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. <br><br>On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. <br><br>Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an <br>automobile accident. <br><br>On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. <br><br>This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. <br><br>According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. <br><br>Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old manï¿½&#402ï¿½&#8217ï¿½&#8224ï¿½&#8364&#8482ï¿½&#402ï¿½&#8364&#353ï¿½&#8218Â¢ï¿½&#402ï¿½&#8217ï¿½&#8218Â¢ï¿½&#402Â¢Ã¢ï¿½&#8364&#353Â¬ï¿½&#8230Â¡ï¿½&#402ï¿½&#8364&#353ï¿½&#8218Â¬ï¿½&#402ï¿½&#8217ï¿½&#8218Â¢ï¿½&#402Â¢Ã¢ï¿½&#8364&#353Â¬ï¿½&#8230Â¾ï¿½&#402ï¿½&#8364&#353ï¿½&#8218Â¢s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. <br><br>This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.<br><br>A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiaryext of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds arrive your country. <br><br>There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately ONLY via any of my alternate private email addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you. <br><br>Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.<br> <br>Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. S! o, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it.

After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.

Myhusband who was one of the best farmers in our countryand treasurer of the farmer's CO-pperation did notsuport his idea and so the party members invaded myhusband's farms and burnt everything in the farm,Killed my husband and made away with a lot of items inmy husband's farm.    After the death of my husband, i and my childerndecided to move out of Zimbabwe because our lives werein danger with the money that my husband kept in hishidden safe in my house. The amount contained in thesafe is US$24.2M (TWENTY FOUR.TWO MILLION UNITED SATESDOLLAR) and we decided to code the money and move tothe Republic of SOUTH AFRICA where we deposited themoney in a SECURITY COMPANY as a valuable item.So idecided to make contact with an overseas firm whomwill assist me to move this money out of South Africa,because we are asylum seekers here in South Africa.   So if you consider this proppsal, we have agreed togive you 30% of the total sum for helping us to movethis money out to your country and 10% will be mappedout for expenses both of us may incur during thistransaction and 60% Will be for me and family toinvest in your country.

The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner and from Iraq in particular and I am certainly sure that he is dead, and nobody will come again for the claim of this money A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder;therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction to get this money transfered into your safety hand.I will provide the necessary information needed in order to claim this money, But you will need to open an account where this can be transferred. If interested send your private Telephone No. And Fax number including full details of the account to be used for the Deposit I wish for utmost confidentiality in handling this  transaction as my job and the future of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached.I want to assure you that the transaction is without risk if due process is followed accordingly.

"From John Beyerle ... Perhaps the Russians won't send troops:I just called Karasin. He agreed that the situation had gotten worse in Osh and Jalalabad today but said the Russianposition is still that sending in foreign troops whether Russian or CSTO will be counterproductive and lead to moreviolence and bloodshed.The IL-76s that flew in to Kant today were the EMERCOM/M4C planes he told me about yesterday; they havehumanitarian cargo primarily doctors and medical equipment. I cited the news reports that a battalion of paratroopershad gone in -- he said there may be some troops on board to guard the plane or beef up security at Kant but he wasfirm that at this point Russia has no plans to introduce its own forces in the south. The main objective was to stop theviolence through peaceful means; Russia had provided the Kyrgyz forces with additional ""technical means"" foraccomplishing that. He said they hoped this would help Kyrgyz forces get control of the situation which was their maingoal.I asked about CSTO planning and possible UN or OSCE PKFs. He said there is no formal CSTO meeting plannedalthough people are consulting via phone. He repeated their hesitation to see any CSTO deployments. They have notyet considered UN or OSCE PKFs but if the situation continues to deteriorate he wouldn't exclude the possibility.Rushailo is currently in Moscow but may be sent to Bishkek tomorrow or Tuesday. He agreed to call me if there is anymajor change in the situation on the ground or regarding force deployments. Tomorrow is a Russian holiday but he'llhave his cell phone on."

Here inNIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high reputewith years of outstanding service to the people ofAfrica.I have resolved to contact you through thismedium based on business proposal that will be ofmutual benefit to both of us.I got your particulars through a consultant companybase on my research for atrustworthy and establishedperson that understands investment ethic for enteringinto a life time profitable joint partnershipinvestment and also co-operation with confidence andtrust that you willkeep the contents secret anddivulged to any third party.To be explicit and straight to the point. Some timeearly 1997, a reputable client of ours depositedaconsignment in our company\'s vault for safekeeping.And since then our client has failed to comeforward to claim his consignment, which hasaccumulated aconsiderable amount of money indemurrage.Consequently, in our bide to contact thisclient to redeem the demurrage which his consignmenthad accumulated we discovered that our client was theformer president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, whodied of illness after he was de-throwed in the sameyear the consignment was entrusted into our care.Sincethe death of our client President Mobutou Seseseko,none of his benefactors has come forward to claim theconsignment with us, which means that non of hisrelatives or aids had any knowledge of thisconsignment.Hence out of curiosity I decided to secretly open thetwo boxes that our client deposited in our vault. Andto my surprise I discovered that the two boxes thatwere registered as treasurer by our client actuallycontained a considerable amount of money in UnitedStates Dollars amounting to about US$30 millionDollar. Since this development I have been nursingplans secretly. I also found out from enquiries andthe foreign media that our late client siphoned a lotof money from his country while he was in office ashead of state.It is my conviction that the consignmentin our vault was part of the money that our clientsiphoned and now that he is dead there is no race tothis money in our care.I am now soliciting your nobleassistance to assist me in transferring this money outof nigeria to your country for immediate investmentwith your assistance.I have also decided that you willgenerously been titled to 30% of the total amount.Upon my receiptof your reply confirming yourwillingness to assist me of this transaction, I willimmediately arrange and transfer all the rights ofownership of this consignment to your name tofacilitate your easy clearance and transfer of thecomplete funds to yourcountry.you have nothing to worry about, as I will be thereto assist you in anyway necessary with all properdocumentation.This transaction is 100% risk free.Please maintainabsolute confidentiality on this matter.Please reply to the above email address with yourtelephone and fax so can call you.Thanks.Yours faithfully.MR.ISA MUHAMEED__________________________________________________________________Get Tiscali Broadband From =A315:99http://www.tiscali.co.uk/products/broadbandhome/"

The more people who join in, the more profitable for everyone on the list. If you are going to use a mailing list, please make sure it is from a reputable source and includes people who have ""Opted In"". These lists contain names of people who have no objections to receiving these types of mails. The e-mail that you will send out will contain a copy of this document in your new email message. (You can edit and format the message text in any way you want! However, it's best to just leave the text as it is because you want your email to be read by everyone who receives it).Delete the e-mail address at No 1 in the list and move the others up one place (2 becomes 1, 3 becomes 2 etc)No 5 in the list will be empty, so put YOUR address in this space. (This is the e-mail address you used to sign up to PayPal), your email is now ready for sending! A word of warning! Don't be tempted to add your email address to position 1 in order to earn money fast! It doesn't work like that! If you do that, you will ONLY reach the people you directly send emails to, and then your address will be immediately removed from the No 1 place and you won't reach any more people! However, if you add your name to the No 5 position, there will be literally tens of thousands of people receiving and sending e-mail's later - when your name has reached the No 1spot!!! When you send out your e-mails, your address will initially be at No 5 in the list. The response-rate for this program is much higher than any typical email marketing campaign for a number of reasons, which are explained later. As long as you send your e-mails to people who are likely to be interested in this program, you can expect an average response from about 25% of the people you send to. Let's be conservative here and assume that you receive only an average response rate of 12.5%. If you send out your email to 40 different people, you can expect at least 5 of those people to do exactly what you did (12.5% of 40 = 5). By this time, your email address will have moved up to No 4 in the list, and this list will now have reached around 200 people (5 x 40). Out of those 200 people, you can expect at least 25 of them to participate (12.5% of 200 = 25), so that's a further 1,000 emails (25 x 40) being sent out and your email address will have risen to No 3 in the list. Out of those 1,000 people, you can expect at least 125 of them to participate (12.5% of 1,000 = 125), so that's a further 5,000 emails (125 x 40) being sent out with you now at the No 2 position. Out of those 5,000 people, you can expect at least 625 of them to respond (12.5% of 5,000 = 625), so that's 25,000 emails (625 x 40) being sent out with YOUR ADDRESS at the No 1 spot! Now, out of those 25,000 people, you can expect around 3,125 of them to respond (12.5% of 25,000 = 3,125). And since you will now be at No 1 in the list, you will receive ï¿½3 (ï¿½5/$5) from each of them, that's; ï¿½9,375 (3,125 x ï¿½3(ï¿½5/$5). So, when your name starts to hit the No 1 position within the next few days, it will be YOUR turn to collect the money! Over the course of 30 days the money will be sent to you, by a few thousand people just like yourself. The first payments will arrive within a few days, and they will continue at the rate of about 100 payments per day for about 30 days. After that time, the volume of payments begins to taper off as your e-mail address vacates the No 1 position. "

I want a church or individual thatwill use this to fund churches, orphanages and widowspropagating the word of God and to ensure that thehouse of God is maintained. The Bible made us tounderstand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this decision because I don?t have any childthat will inherit this money and my husband relativesare not Christians and I don?t want my husband?s hardearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don?twant a situation where this money will be used in anungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bolddecision. I am not afraid of death hence I know whereI am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossomof the Lord.Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my caseand I shall hold my peace. I don?t need any telephonecommunication in this regard because of my health,andbecause of the presence of my husband?s relativesaround me always. I don?t want them to know about thisdevelopment. With God all things are possible. As soonas I receive your reply I shall give you the contactof the Finance/Security Company Europe. I will alsoissue you a letter of authority that will empower youas the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want youand the church to always pray for me because the lordis my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life ofa worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve theLord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please alwaysbe prayerful all through yourlife.Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcingfor a church or christian individual for this samepurpose. Please assure me that you will actaccordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear fromyou.please reply me through this email;<mrsjfpeters@postmaster.co.uk>Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.Yours in Christ,Mrs Juliana faith peters.__________________________________________________Broadband from an unbeatable =A315.99!http://www.tiscali.co.uk/products/broadband/home.html?code=3DSM-NL-11AM"

"Dear,I am Dr. M. Tutu, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am anExecutive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & NaturalResources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach youfor a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due toConfidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed thata member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was atthe Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gaveyour enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek aconfidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal describedhereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as atop secret because of the nature of this transaction.Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as anExecutive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials,we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - SixMillion, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars, which we want to transferabroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individualto receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-companyaccount to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in thecircumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does notallow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the wholetransaction.This amount Twenty-Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand represents thebalance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department bya foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiceddeliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to theoriginal contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amountwhich we have in principles gotten approval to remit by TelegraphicTransfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing inan application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for thetransfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, henceprovide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be sendacross to you.I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you bewilling to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25%of the (Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars).70% forus and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy andconfidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance tothe successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidencein you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact meimmediately through my above Tel/Fax number or my e-mail address, whetheror not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable mescout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assureyou that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment ofthis claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance andguarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat thismatter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend withany form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service andremember once again that time is of the essence in this business.I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.Yours faithfully,Dr. M. Tutu  "
" Dr.Morgen Akin BestLagos-AfricaDear Friend,I, on behalf of my colleagues from the Federal Government of Nigeria owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards transfer of US$21,500,000.00 (Twenty-one Million, five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) into your bank account. These funds emanated from unclaimed contractual proceeds of foreign contracting firms who could not meet their financial obligations to their creditors. We, as holders of sensitive positions in our various parastatals, were mandated by the Federal Government to scrutinize all payments made to certain Foreign contractors and we discovered that some of the contractors have not been paid their contractual entitlement which collectively left the sum of US$35,500,000.00 (Thirty-Five Million, five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) lying in a suspended Account.However, from our investigations, we discovered that the foreign beneficiary companies have since been liquidated, and to all intents and purposes no longer exist in Nigeria, thus providing us with this Opportunity, provided that we have a capable partner, to execute a transaction of this nature. We agreed that the said amount would be transferred into an overseas Bank Account to be provided by a Reliable foreign firm/associate. This is because as serving Government workers the Civil Service Code does not allow us to operate foreign Account. In our initial attempt to do this, we succeeded in transferring part of this amount US$14m (Fourteen Million Dollars) into aUnited States Dollar Account in Beirut, Lebanon, but our foreign associate failed to honour our mutual agreement insisting instead that the total amount be transferred into the Account before we can share the money.As a result, we have lost confidence in the ability of our Lebanese partner to see this matter to its logical conclusion, and until the initial transaction is satisfactorily resolved, we have cancelled further transactions with him. In the light of the foregoing, it is clear that we require a partner that is not only capable of rendering assistance and cooperation in executing this matter, but will honour the terms of agreement when we reach the concluding stages of this transaction. We therefore offer the amount of 20% of the entire sumin return for services/assistance rendered in successfully carrying out this project. We trust that you appreciate the sensitive nature of this matter and the need for initial caution on our part, but when a Relationship is confidently established and operations commence you will be provided with all relevant information.I remain at your disposal to entertain any questions/enquiries relating to this proposition and you may contact me as a matter of urgency via e-mail, for further information on the procedures and requirements of this transaction. In your reply, remember to indicate a safe telephone number where I can always reach you. Hope to hear from you soon. Please treat with the strictest confidentiality and expediency.Yours faithfully,Dr.Morgen Akin Best"

"HANG SENG BANK LTD.=0DDES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,=0DCENTRAL HONG KONG,=0DHONG KONG.=0D=0DDear Sir,=0D=0D Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of =the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.B=efore the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was wi=th the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit f=or 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thous=and United State Dollars only in my branch.Upon maturity several notice w=as sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war = another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We la=ter find out that the General and his family had been killed during the w=ar in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was a=lso discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin i=n his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And h=e also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one excep=t me knew of his deposit in my bank. =0D So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still =lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it.

It is only 8 minutes long but a great overview of the Arc visionand its potential for enabling peace in the region. I promise you it is worth it. It has tested very well with bothPalestinians Israelis and American Jews and Palestinians. It is a genuinely a transformational idea that did not originatefrom American politicians or diplomats but rather from innovative American minds in collaboration with stakeholdersfrom all walks of life in Palestine Israel the US Europe and the Muslim world. And it could be largely financed withprivate finance.AM

" Dear Sir, REQUEST FOR YOUR UNRESERVED ASSISTANCE Firstly, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret.Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any oneapprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at theend of the day. We have decided to contact you due to the urgency of thistransaction, as we have been reliably informed of it's swiftness andconfidentiality. Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you. I am DR.ANAYO AWKA , a Manager at the Union Bank Nigeria PLC, Lagos. I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence. A foreigner, Late Engineer William Adams, an oil Merchant /contractor with the federal Government of Nigeria, until his death three years ago in a ghastly air crash, banked with us here at the Union Bank PLC ,Lagos, and had a closing balance of USD$22.2M (Twenty-Two Million, Two Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)which the bank now unquestionably expects to be claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively be donated to a discredited trust fund for arms and ammunition at a military war collage here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the Union Bank to get in touch with any of late Engr. William Adams's next of kin (he had no known wife and children) that the management under the influence of our chairman, board of directors, Retired Major General Kalu Uke Kalu, that an arrangement for the fund to be declared ""UNCLIAMABLE "" and then be subsequently donated to the trust fund for Arms and Ammunition, which will further enhance thecourse of war in Africa and the world in general. In order to avert this negative development, myself and some of my trusted colleagues in the bank now seek for your permission to have you stand as late Engr.WILLIAMS ADAMSs next of kin so that the fund, USD$22.2M, would be subsequently transferred and paid into your bank account as thebeneficiary next of kin. All documents and proves to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and we are assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amoun!t.! 10% has been set aside for expenses, while the rest would befor myself and my colleagues for purposes in your country. If this proposal is OK by you and you do not wish to take advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly get to me immediately via my e-mail address furnishing me with your most confidential telephone, fax and e-mail, so that I can forward to you the relevant details of this transaction. Thank you in advancefor your anticipated co-operation.Regards. DR. ANAYO AWKA (MANAGER UNION BANK OF NIGERIA PLC). "

"Dear Sir,I am Mr.Tambo, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($26,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send across to you.I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the $26,.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above Tel/Fax number or my e-mail address, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.Yours faithfully,Mr. Tambo   "
That makes sense so go ahead. Thx.
"I know you will be surprised to read from me, but  please consider this as a request from a family indire need of assistance.First, I must introduce  myself. I am MR. SITHOLE BALOY from Angola. I amthe first and only son of BRIGADIER BALOY JONES. I  am presently resident in South Africa. I got your contact address from a business directory  in Johannesburg Chamber of commerce and Industry. On  behalf of my widowed mother MRS. ELIZABETH BALOY, I  desided to solicit for your assistance to transfer  the sum of US$21.5 MILLION( TWENTY ONE MILLION FIVE  HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS)inherited  from my late father, into your personal company'saccount.Before my fathers' death, he was a Brigadier in  charge of Arms and Ammunation procurement for the Angola  Army. In his WILL, he specifically drew my attention  to the said sum of money which he deposited in a  safe box of a private Security Company in Johannesburg-  South Africa in a treasure box, fully documented in  my name. IN FACT MY FATHER SAID AND I QUOTE  MY BELOVED SON, I WISH TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TOUS$21.5 MILLION . I DEPOSITED THE BOX CONTAINING THIS MONEY IN A SECURITY COMPANY IN JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH  AFRICA. DURING THE WAR, I WAS VERY DEDICATED AND  OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONARIES WERE BUSSY  HELPING THEMSELVES WITH GOVERNMENT FUNDS ANDPROPERTIES AND SENDING THEM TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  DUE TO THIS, WHEN I AND MY FORMER SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE  PRESIDENT WERE ASSIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT (EDUARDO  SANTOS) TO PURCHASE ARMS IN SOUTH AFRICA, WE SAW  THIS AS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY AND DIVERTED THE MONEY AND  DIVIDED IT. i GOT A TOTAL SUM OF US$21.5 MILLION. IN  CASE OF MY ABSENCE ON EARTH, AS A RESULT OF DEATH  ONLY, YOU SHOULD SOLICIT FOR THE FUND FOR INVESTMENTPURPOSES. >From the above, you will understand that the lives  and future of my family depens on this money, as such I  will be grateful if you can assist us. We are now  living in South Africa as political Asylum seekersand financial laws and regulation of the Republic of  South Africa do not permit us financial rights to suchhuge sum of money. In view of this, I cannot invest this  fund in South africa, hence i am prepared to offer  you 20% of the total fund, while 10% will be set aside  for local and international expenses and 70% will be for  my family and me.  Finally, modalities on howthe transfer will be bone  will be conveyed to you once we have established  trus and confidence between ourselves. Please treat this  matter as very urgent.  Best regards, SITHOLE BALOY. From r  Mon May 31 12:47:34 2004"

"Zhang He, Bank of China.. ShenzhenChina. Dear Friend, I am Zhang He, Bank Manager of the Bank of China, Shenzhen branch, China. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 7, 2000, a consultant/ contractor with the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation, made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at Twenty One Million Dollars (US$21,000,000.00) only in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to the forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Korea Solid Minerals Corporation that he died along with his wife from a plane crash. On further investigation, I found out that he died Without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that he did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of China, at the expiration of eight (8) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Korea Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to assist me in receiving this money as I have every machinery set to enable you receiver this money via a Finance firm based overseas. I need your urgent assistance so that this money will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will require you to send me your complete names, contact address and telephone and fax numbers so that I will be able to apply for the necessary documents to enable you receive the money via the Finance firm overseas in your name. After receiving the money, we will share in the ratio of 75% for me and 25% for you. Note that the project will be 100% risk free. Considering my position as the credit officer of the bank, I guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. I have the facilities to obtain relevant documents to enable me lift the money from the bank overseas. If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon your response, I will then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. I will also let you have the contact details of the Finance Firm and the country it is located in Overseas. Please send me your confidential TELEPHONE and FAX Numbers for fast communication, as I will need to speak to you to personally. You should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us. Please reply through my secure email zhanghe_1967@163.com Awaiting your urgent reply.  Thanks and regards.  Zhang He."

"FYI:Brazilian FM defends dialogue with IranBRASILIA Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said Tuesday Brazil would maintain negotiationswith Iran on uranium enrichment and oppose any sanctions against Iran.Amorim said Brazil was against the production of nuclear weapons but Iran had the right to carry out a peaceful nuclearprogram.""Dialogue is still possible. What we want is to make sure (that the uranium will not be used to make weapons) throughpeaceful ways and dialogue"" Amorim told reporters.Under a draft deal brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) the UN nuclear watchdog most of Iran'sexisting low-grade enriched uranium should be shipped to Russia and France where it would be processed into fuel rodswith a purity of 20 percent.Iran declared on Tuesday it had started the process of producing 20-percent enriched uranium inside the country.In response to Iran's announcement the U.S.-led Western countries have warned to take political and economicsanctions against Iran.For his part Amorim said he considered any kind of sanctions ineffective and dangerous because they might cross a limitand jeopardize peace.Iran's president made an official visit to Brazil in November during which the Brazilian government defended Iran's rightto have its own peaceful nuclear program including uranium enrichment similar to Brazil's following internationalstandards."

"DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO.TEL:44 7775770781EMAIL:temijohnson@rediffmail.com Dear Sir, SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in soinformal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreignpartner. This request may seem strange andunsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is MR TEMI JOHNSON of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessedmemory, may his soul rest in peace. Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA toforce out the rebels in my country, I and some of mycolleagues were instructed by Late President Kabilato  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth ofTwenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately  decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary.WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in the europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance.Our inability to move this money out of Congo allThis while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information We gathered from an associatewho has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modestyand honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality.Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share(percentage) for assisting us.I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this Matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your Decision, while I await your prompt response. Thank you and GodBless.  Best RegardsMR TEMI JOHNSON"

I hope that you will not expose or b=etray this trust and confidence that I am about to repose on you for the mu=tual benefit of our both families.I am writing in respect of a foreign cust=omer of our Bank who perished along with his next of kin with Korean Air Li=ne, flight number 801 with the whole passengers on 6th of august 1997 and f=or your perusal you can view this site http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/gua=m.passenger.listSince the demise of this our customer, I personally have wa=tched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive= as no one has come to claim his funds of US$11.3M (Eleven Million Three Hu=ndred Thousand United States Dollars) which has been with our branch for a =very long time.On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be u=sed as the Next of Kin since nobody is coming for the fund again. The Banki=ng ethics here do not allow such money to stay more than 10 years, because =the money will be recalled to our Banks treasury as unclaimed fund after th=is period.In view of this I got your contact through the Internet when I wa=s making a research on a foreigner that I will use in this great opportunit=y because I don't want the money to be recalled to our Bank treasury as unc=laimed fund. I have also agreed to offer 40% of the total sum and the rest =60% will be for me.The reason for a foreigner in the business is for the fact that the decease=d man was a foreigner and it is not authorized by the law guiding our Bank =for a citizen of this country to make the claim of the fund.So the request =for you as a foreigner to come into the business is necessary, it will faci=litate the release and transfer of the fund smoothly into your reliable Ban=k account as the only surviving relation to the deceased.If you are really =sure of your integrity, trustworthy and confidentiality, and accept not to =cheat or disappoint me after this business, reply with your telephone and f=ax numbers and Banking account details where you wish to receive the fund.U=pon receipt of the above mentioned information, indicating your interest in= the business, I will send you by fax or e-mail a letter of application whi=ch you will type and send back to our bank to enable us start this transact=ion.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is risk free= and doesn't have any negative implication. You should not entertain any fe=ar as all modalities for the smooth and easy transfer of this fund have bee=n finalized.

"Demak Laut street,93050 Kuching,SarawakMalaysia.  Dear Friend,        I am the above named person but now undergoing medical treatment now. I am married to Sheik Sharif Ahmed who worked with South Africa Embassy in Malaysia for nine years before he died in the year 2000. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both are Muslims.            Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which my prinsple is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $5.3Million (Five Million three hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with one Security Finance Company in Europe.  Presently, this money is still with the Security Finance Company .         Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to any Islamic or better still an muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in.          I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the Dubai,Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the one that is with the  Security Finance Company.I want a muslam or individual that will use this to fund Islamic orphanages and widows propagating the word of Allah and to ensure that the house of Allah is maintained.         I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money  USD$5.3M and my husband relatives are not Muslam. and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers.          I don't want a situation where these money USD$5.3M will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Allah the almight.          I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health,and because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always who are not muslam. I don't want them to know about this development.         With Allah  all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Security Finance Company abroad. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the Islamic to always pray for me because the Allah is my shephard.         Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a muslam or Islamic individual for this same purpose.             l will require your Personal Phone number and if possible your Residential address to include in the Power of Attorney that my lawyer will prepare in your name as the Beneficiary that will empower you to act on my behalf when you contact the Security Finance Company to receive the money USD$5.3M on my behalf.           The Holy Quran emphasizes so much on Allah's benevolence and this has encourage me to take the bold step.I took this decision because of my faith as a Muslim ,and with Allah every things are possible. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you.  Allah be with youMrs. Zainab Sharif  Ahmed  		"

"Dear Friend,First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction.This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL AND TOP SECRET. However after series of petition was recieved by this present regime from foreign contractors and inability of the BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)to fulfill their obligation for the payment to its foreign creditors, in conjunction with the council of ministers, they mandated us to carry out a careful and comprehensive review of all overdue payments to foreign contractors and to effect payments immediately.During the above mentioned process, we discovered an abandoned sum of US$10.M (Ten million US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with hisentire famil in a plane crash that happened in Kenya, East Africa.Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.Please I want you to visit the website below for more information about the Plane Crash:www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/20/kenya.crash/index.htmlIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety andsubsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.I agree that 40% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account,and 50% would be for me, while 10% will be for expenses incure during the transaction. There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated.Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location wherein the money will be remitted.Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you by email the text of the application to fill and send to the bank. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free risk and this transaction will only take us14 banking days because as a banker, I know what to do and move the fund into your account without any delay and thatyou should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangement have been made for the transfer.You should contact me as soon as you receive this letter so that I will send you the text of the application to apply to the bank.Yours faithfully.MR ISIAKA AKIDABill & Exchange Manager,BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)------------------------------------------Faites un voeu et puis Voila ! www.voila.fr "
DUP has gone behind closed doors at Stormont and the smart money is on them emerging at some point supporting thedeal.There was movement today on the ancillary issue of government support for the Presbyterian Mutual Society a savingsand loan that lost a lot of money and whose investors didn't get the same financial crisis protections as those in otherinstitutions. DUP members are pointing to that as enough of a carrot to change their posture on the policing and justicedeal.Brown and Cowen are poised to go to NI tomorrow. Will keep you posted.
Take a bow.Best.cdm

Here are a few odds and ends:Since I'm going to the Bahrain Manama Conf in December I want to decide where else I might go. The. climate conf inMexico will be held Nov 29-Dec 10. There is also a Dec 10 conf on trafficking in Luxor sponsored by Mrs. Mubarak thatMelanne hopes I could attend.Add to list of meetings the following--Ron KirkHilda SolisWalter Isaacsonâhigh prioritySandy LevinLoretta SanchezMax BaucusEliot EngelBen Cardin wants me to come give a speech about the 35th anniversary of the Helsinki Accords on the Hill so I thought IfI'm going back to Helsinki for a speech about the Helinski Accords in July maybe I should do the Hill speech around thattime.Also Cheryl wants a staff retreat/meeting so what about May 14 or 28?Did you get info about the Vietnam symposium the State historian Carland invited me to open on 9/29?I want to plan to go to the Arctic Council in Greenland next April.Did you find out when Cong Reyes's conf on border security was in August?
"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/dec/23/bitter-new-washington/The New York Review of BooksIn the Bitter New WashingtonDecember 23 2010â¢;izaibeth O wOf course Obama should have gotten out of Washington more and listened to people not just talked at them; and asWalter Mondale said recently he should have gotten rid of ""those idiot boards""âthe TelePrompters on which the greatorator has been strangely dependent and which divide him from his audiences. Last year a friend of mine was invited to aHanukkah party that the Obamas gave for prominent Jews (a group with whom there had been tensions) and after theObamas descended the grand stairway they stood in the foyer briefly; the President made a few remarks and shook afew hands and back up the stairs they went. No mingling.In their first two years the Obamas have seemed a bit tone-deaf: there were too many vacations while people werehurting especially Michelle's extravagant trip to Spain. (I'm as interested in Michelle's clothes as the next woman but atthe same time think she and her staff are too focused on her looking smashing which she does. Her wardrobe seemsquite extensive for these troubled times.)Barack Obama's personality has been much mulled over in the past two years but it seems inescapable that his high self-esteem often slides over the thin line to arrogance which trickles down (with some exceptions) to much of his staff someof whom are downright rude to all but a chosen few. Â°barna has seemed uninterested in anyone but his immediate groupand three of the four members of his immediate circle--Jarrett Robert Gibbs David Axelrodâhad had no experience ingoverning. The fourth Rahm Emanuel expressed himself with such flippancy arrogance and overuse of the F-word thathe offended not just members of Congress but also would-be allies of the President.Vice President Joe Bider) who is liked on Capitol Hill was virtually shut out of the dealings with people in Congress in thefirst two yearsâ""I can handle them"" Obama told Bidenâbut Biden is now expected to be given a larger role as part of theWhite House's new determination to ""reach out."" (A few months ago highly placed members of the staff also swore theywould ""reach out"" but that seemed to last for just a few days.) One of the oddest aspects of Obama's persona is thatsomeone who seems so confident has insisted thus far in having people around him with whom he is said to be""comfortable.""For example Torn Donilon his recently appointed national security adviser (a promotion from his role as deputy) is by allaccounts a capable man but is no one's idea of a serious strategic thinker. The explanation I was given for Donilon'sbeing given his new position was that ""the President is comfortable with him."" Just as Obama is described as pleased withhimself he has been treated with hero worship by much of his staff. After all he had taken on the formidable Clintonsand against the expectation of almost all the pundits and the experts he had beaten them. Why should he listen to thosewho had doubted him? A common complaint about the Obama White House in the first two years has been that therewere no ""grown-ups"" around people who knew more about governing and who would tell Obama that he was wrong.When people tried to suggest someone who should be brought in that person was rejected as ""not one of ours."" JoeBiden is said to argue with Obama on issues such as Afghanistan but not to get into the management of the WhiteHouse....Those who supported Obama in 2008 expected him to be able to move public opinion to get people to follow him. Thefact that the Obama White House has been so poor at ""messaging"" baffles even his strongest supporters. In fact he hadno overall message. As Winston Churchill put it there was no theme to his pudding. When I asked a White House aideabout this he pointed to what had been billed as a ""major speech on the economy"" at Georgetown University in April2009. But the speech was utterly forgettableâand forgotten. One ally attributes this problem to the inexperience of bothObama and his top staff. An ally says ""You can't leave a message if you don't have a strategy and you don't know whereyou're going."" Another says ""They had something that worked in the campaign but didn't work in the White House.""Thus Obama didn't see the need to explain what he was doing. His 2010 campaign themes seemed to wander all overthe place: Stanley Greenberg a pollster and former aide to Bill Clinton said that Obama's oft-used theme that weshouldn't go back to the Bush days actually tested negatively because people didn't believe that the country was makingeconomic progress.So Obama's biggest failure was not to be the leader that so many expected him to be. The jubilation that surrounded hisswearing-in may have gone to his head while the celebrants overlooked that there were plenty of people out there whowere not overjoyed at the advent of a black president or even a Democrat. Obama was apparently in his own estimationso smart and so adored that he seems to have felt no need to explainâand explain againâto the country what he wasdoing and to take the country along with him. This failure to put his programs across came up a few times in the 2010campaign....More than once people in town hall meetings told him that they were behind him but were having great trouble trying todefend or explain his agenda. In a backyard gathering on October 21 he made the most awkward reply of those I heard:""Our attitude was that we just had to get the policies right and we didn't always think about making sure we got theadvertising properly about what was going on."" Advertising. (When I mentioned this to a Democratic senator who wasgenerally supportive of Obama this ordinarily polite man responded ""Bullocks! What policies?"")The risk-averse Obama had left it to Congress to write the big bills such as on the economic stimulus and health care(with strong participation by White House aides). But he kept up this line of defense all the way through to his patheticpress conference on the day after the election. In these comments Obama gave away the devastating fact that he didn'treally understand the role of the president as leader. A friend of the Obama administration said to me ""Their definition ofgoverning is passing bills."" Someone else relatively close to the White House explained that since Obama had been socriticized for being ""arrogant"" and ""aloof"" he had to eat large portions of humble pie.

"THREE THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS  ONLY TO YOUR ACCOUNT}Attn:I feel quite safe dealing with you in this important business having gone through your remarkable profile on the internet. Though, this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However, this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated as such.At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both parties.My name is MR TONY HILL I work as the operational manager in account management section in charge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a Balance Of US$48,223,000. 00 (Forty eight million two hundred and twenty three thousand U.S dollar).On further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has died long ago with his family on a fatal Auto-accident leaving no beneficiary to the  account and no other person knows about this account.I am in close contact with the manager of the bank here who is my partner and he is willing to approve the transfer to any reliable and trustworthy  foreigner with foreign bank account because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner and from Australia in particular. I am certainly sure that he has no writen or oral WILL attached to the account , no  beneficiary and nobody will come again for the claim of this money. It is only a foreigner who can claim this money with legal claims to the account holder  which I will provide to you if you are interested, therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. The difference in country of origins is not a hindrance to the success of this transaction. This money will remain useless in this dormant account if I did not transfer the fund out to a foreign account.I will provide the necessary information and documents needed in order to claim this money. I only need your cooperation as a foreigner to provide your safe bank account information for the transfer. All arrangement  that will ensure a smooth transfer of the fund to the account which you are to nominate is already in place.You should also provide me with your direct  phone lines for easy communication. I wish for utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction.At the conclussion of this transaction, your share will be 25% of the total transfer sum, 70% for me and my partner while 5% will be set aside for any  expenses both parties might incure during the process of the transfer. The fund will be transferred to your account in two parts. I will first transfer USD 20 Million to your account. I will fly over to meet you  after the successful transfer for sharing according to the agreed percentages. I will  have the remaining balance of USD28,223 Million transferred to your account only after the successful sharing of the first transfer without any disappointment from your side.I am looking forward to have a reply from you through my E-mail or you can call me or fax me.If you want to call my No. dial the way you use to call other countries, do not put South African area code which is 27, because it is a satellite phone which I bourght for this transaction for the security reason because our local land line here is not secured.Let me hear from you.Best Regards,MR.TONY HILL_________________________________________________________________Search & browse smarter, faster - download MSN Search Toolbar today, it's FREE! http://toolbar.msn.co.za?DI=1054&XAPID=2083"

We later found out that Hamadi Hashem and his familyhad been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home atMukaradeeb where his personal oil well was.After furtherinvestigation it was also discovered that Hamadi Hashem didnot declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paperworkof his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at myoffice that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.So, Forty Fourmillion Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bankand no one will ever come forward to claim it.What bothers me most is thataccording to the laws of my country at the expiration five years six monthsthe funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.My proposal, I am prepared to place you as the next of kin in a position toinstruct HANG SENG BANK to release the deposit to you as the closest"

Two days before his death, he managed to sneak a written message to us, explaining his condition and concerning one trunk box of valuables containing money and gold, which he deposited with a private Security &amp; Finance Company in Abidjan Cote d'Iviore.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>He instructed me to take our two children(Ibrahim and Zinat) and move out of Sierra-Leone immediately to Abidjan Cote d'Iviore before the Peace Keeping Forces of the Economic Community of West African States<BR>(ECOMOG) monitoring team intervened to arrest the situation of mass killings by the rebels, which was the order of the day. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Eventually it resulted into full war. I became a widow overnight; helpless situation without partner. At that moment of calamity, every person was running for his/her life. In the content of the deed he signed with the Security Company, he used the name of his son Master Ibrahim Keita as the next of kin. The real content of the box were not disclosed to the Security Company due to security reasons. Now as a refugee, we have very limited financial rights here, we intend to leave this country immediately with the whole money for investment in your country because of the stable situation and mostly for the future benefits of my children. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>We have since applied for political asylum. The cash involved inside in the box is US$&nbsp;10.5 Million (&nbsp;Ten million and&nbsp;five hundred thousand united state dollars). I want you to assist us to claim the box from the Security Company as the new beneficiary so that the change ownership of the documents covering this consignment/box will be legally effected to your name as to enable you have this money deposited in a local account&nbsp;here in Abidjan in your name&nbsp;for the easier transfer of this money in to your oversaes bank account. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>We also source for good investment so that we can invest the money wisely. We have in mind to establish a rewarding investment and good relationship with you. Concerning the money, we are prepared to offer you a reasonable percentage of 20% of the total sum proceeds. Meanwhile 5% has been mapped out for any expenses you may incurred in the course of this transaction and 75% will be for my family.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>For the interest of this business, do not hesitate to contact us with the above email addresss immediately you receive this message for more information to enable us proceed in earnest towards concluding all our arrangements. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>No other person knows about this money apart from my children and I. We await your most urgent response. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Thanks for your co-operation and God bless you.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Best regards, </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV></DIV></DIV>Madam Keita.</DIV></DIV><p>		<hr size=1> Yahoo!

"Bismillahir Rahmaanir Raheem,Assalamo Alaikum,Wasalaam to you,and how are you doing?. My intention of contacting you is to =solicit your assistance for a project,  which will be mutually beneficial. =Though I know my decision to contact you is to a large extent unconventional, =the  prevailing circumstances necessitated my action. I am Haleema  Hamza =from Libya. I am married to Late Mallam Mustafa Hamza of blessed memory was =an oil explorer in Libya and Kuwait for twelve years before he died in the =year 2000. We were married  for twelve years without a child. He died after a =brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both =devoted Muslims.

(I will tell you =the amount as we proceed).Recently, my doctor told me that I have only few months to live due to cancer =problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my =condition I decided to donate this fund to either a Muslim organization or =devoted Muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to =instruct herein. My parents died at a tender age and i was brought up in the =orphanage through the help of a devouted muslim.I want this Muslim =organization or individual to use this money in all sincerity to fund =mosques,  orphanages, widows, and also propagating the word of ALLAH and to =ensure that the society upholds the views and belief of the Holy Quran.The Holy Quran emphasizes so much on ALLAH'S benevolence and this has =encouraged me to take the bold step. I took this decision because I don't =have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are into =some radical Organizations and I don't want a situation where this money will =be used in an Unholy manner. Hence the reasons for this bold decision, I know that after death I will be with ALLAH the most =beneficent and the most merciful. I don't need any telephone communication in =this regard because of my health, because of the presence of my husband's =relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. =With ALLAH all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply on =Email:hhamza@cooltoad.com, I shall give you the contact information of the =Deposit Company in oversea where the money was deposited. I will also issue a =letter of authority to the Deposit Company authorizing them that the said =fund have being willed to you and a copy of such authorization will be =forwarded to you. I want you and the Muslim community where you reside to =always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a true devoted Muslims =worthy of emulation, Whoever that wants to serve ALLAH must serve him in =truth and in fairness. I will not stipulate any precise amount to reward you, =as it will have to be on pre-negotiated terms, based on your level of =involvement. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply =will give room in sourcing for a Muslim organization or a devoted Muslim for =this same purpose.

Do you have a copy of the letter he sent me? I can't find my copy. Thx.
"I, on behalf of my other colleagues from differentorgans of Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) ownedparastatals decided to solicit your assistance asregards transfer of the above-mentioned amount intoyour bank account.  This fund accrued from overinvoicing of various contract awarded in my parastatalto certain Foreign Contractors sometimes ago.We, as holders of sensitive position in our variousparastatals, were mandated by the Federal Governmentto Scrutinise all payments made to certain foreignContractors and we discovered that some of thecontracts they executed were grossly over-invoicedeither by omission or commission.  In the process thesum of US$27M (Twenty Seven Million US Dollars only)was found lying in the parastatal suspense accountafter the foreign contractors had been paid theirrightful dues for executing the said contracts.We all agreed that this over-invoiced amount betransferred (for our own use) into a bank accountprovided by a foreign partner, because we aregovernment workers and the Code of Conduct does notallow us to operate foreign accounts.However, we have succeeded in transferring some ofthis money precisely US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollarsonly) into a foreign account in MOROCCO (NorthAfrica), but the provider of the account in MOROCCO isup to some mischief and refuses to comply to theearlier mutual agreement by insisting that the totalamount be paid into his nominated bank account beforedisbursement will take effect.  If for a meagre sum ofUS$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars only) we are notcompensated, is it when the balance of US$22M(Twenty-two Million US Dollars)is transferred that wewill be sure of our full compensation? Of course, thisabuse of trust and inhumanity calls for soberreflection and search for absolute trust.Thus we are seeking your unwavering assistance thatthe remaining amount of US$22M can be speedilyprocessed and fully remitted into your nominated bankaccount.

He is calling to complain about Ambassador Holbrooke. He feels that Holbrooke is condescending and not forthcomingincluding at this week's hearing. He also has broader concerns about the lack of a clear end state and metrics for ourAfghan policy but the main reason he wants to talk to you is about Holbrooke.Holbrooke tried to faithfully answer his questions and frankly Corker was looking for a sound byte and he got one. Wecan offer him additional briefings and a readout after your upcoming trip if that would help.You could use also this opportunity to thank him for sitting down earlier this week on the New START Treaty; to notethat we received and are following up on his July 14 follow-up letter; and that we want to continue working with him toget him to a place where he can support the treaty.

He was in charge of reviving royalties from the multi-national oil companies and government on behalf of the oil producing communities in Nigeria. </STRONG></P><P><STRONG>After the hanging of the Ogoni Nine(9) including Ken Saro Wave by the late director General Sani Abacha, my father suffered stroke and died in August 27th last year. But before his death, he called me and told me he has Twenty Three Million Five Hundred and Sixty Thousand Dollars (USD23, 560,000.00) cash in his possession, specially deposited in a Security vault company in London.</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>He advised me not to tell anybody except my mother who is the last wife of the (8) eight wives that he married. My mother did not bear any male child for him. Which implies that all my father'properties, Companies e.g., we have no share in them because my mother has no male child according to African Tradition.</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>My father therefore secretly gave me all the relevant documents of the said money, and told me that I should use this money with my mother and my younger sisters because he knows that traditionally; if he dies we cannot get anything, as inheritance. He importantly advised me that I should seek foreign assistance and that I should not invest this money here in Nigeria because of his other wives and male children who happen to be my elders. I am soliciting for your immediate assistance to get a Bungalow for us, where I will live with my mother and two younger sisters and further advise me where and how I will invest the balance money overseas, possibly on products of your company and other profitable ventures.</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>I believe that by the special grace of God, you will help us move this money out of&nbsp;London to any country of your choice where we can invest this money judiciously with you.</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>You are entitled to a reasonable part of this money based on our agreement, and God will bless you as you help us.

"MILLION, TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS)& BUSINESS INVESTMENTS PARTNERSHIP.First, I must solicit your strictest confidence inthis transaction, this is by  virtue of it's nature asbeing utterly confidential and top secret as you wereintroduced to us in confidence through the NigerianChamber of Commerce, foreign trade division. and ifthe contents of this mail does meet with yourapproval, i humbly crave your indulgence. I am the chairman of the Economic Recovery Committe(ERC) set up by the present civilian Government ofNigeria to review economic policies of governmentparastatals, and find out ways to reduce waste andmaximise revenues allocated to them.In the course of our work at the ERC, we discoveredthis fund which resulted from gross re-valuation ofcontracts  by top government officials of the federalministry of Aviation (FMA). The company thatexecuted the contracts have been duly paid and thecontracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$19.2Million lying unclaimed in the escrow account of theCentral Bank of Nigeria.Upon interogation of the directors of engineering andfinance, who both happens to be my contemporaries inthe university, they confessed to me in confidencethat they had an agreement with the originalcontractor to re-value the original contract by 30%.This 30% which amounts to USD19.2m was to be their share from the contract, since the original contractor was well disposed towards giving them the conventional 10% kickback. When I now asked them what they intended to do now that my committee has discovered this USD19.2M. They begged me not to disclose this information to the government as they will likely lose their jobs and their family names destroyed. I was at at a crossroad, as I did not want my friends to suffer for what other top government officials do and get away with. I discussed with the other two members of my committee and we all unanimously agreed to transfer this fund out and share amongst ourselves.I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust bymy colleagues in the committee to look for an overseaspartner to whom we could transfer the sum of US$19.2Mlegally sub-contracting the entitlement to you/yourcompany. This is bearing in mind that our  civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign company or running  foreign account while in government service hence the need for a foreign partner.Should this transaction interest you, you are tocontact me on my personal e-mail address, so that Ican brief you fully, and discuss your renumeration forthis undertaking. All logistics are in place and all modalities workedout for the smooth conclusion of the transaction "

"HELLO FRIEND,Good day and Compliments, I am writing this letter in confidence believing that if it is the wish of God for you to help me and my family, God Almighty will bless and reward you abundantly and youwould never regret this.My family and I are true Christians and worship God truthfully. I got your contact during my search for this assistance. I am a female student from University Burkina Faso, Ouaga. I am 22 yrs old. I'd like any person who can be caring, loving and home oriented. I will love to havea long-term relationship with you and to know more about you.I would like to build up a solid foundation with you in time coming if you can be able to help me in this transaction. Well, my father died earlier three months ago and left I and my junior brother behind. Hewas a king, which our town citizens titled him over sixteen years beforehis death.I was a princess to him and I am the only person who can take care of his wealth now because my junior brother is still young and my mother is not literate enough to know my entire father's wealth.He left the sum of USD 7.350, 000M (Seven Million, Three Hundred and FiftyThousand US Dollars) in a security company.This money was annually paid into my late fathers account from Shell petroleum Development Company (spdc) and chevron Oil Company operating in our locality for the compensation of youth and community development in our jurisdiction.I don't know how and what I will do to invest this money somewhere in abroad, so that my father's kindred will not take over what belongs to my father and our family, which they were planning to do without my consentbecause I am a female as stated by our culture in the town.Now, I urgently need your humble assistance to move this money from the  Security Company to your bank account that is why I felt happy when I saw your contact because I strongly believe that by the grace of God,you will help me invest this money wisely.I am ready to pay 30% of the total amount to you if you help us in this transaction and another 10% interest of Annual after Income to you, for handling this transaction for us, which you will strongly have absolute control over it.If you can handle this project sincerely and also willing to assist me in lifting this fund, kindly reach me. Please, note that this transaction is 100% risk free and I hope to commence the transaction as quick as possible, I will send you my picture as soon as I hear from you for recognition.Yours sincerely,"

.... for terrific talk and discussion. Your robust statement on missiledefense was the best so far. As for your robust push-back on the premiseof my healthcare question I didn't mean to imply that the Clintonadministration's foreign policy agenda suffered back thenârather thatthere's jeopardy to the Obama administration's foreign policy if thecurrent debate/fight turns out badly. But you mooted the whole thing byreassuring us that all will turn out okay.Anyway I've taken an aspirin â and thank you profoundly for a greatevent and of course for the gracious personal touches.S.STROBE TALBOTTBrookings Institution1775 Massachusetts Ave NWWashington DC 20036Tel:Fax: 202.797.2461

"Compliments of the day, My name is Paul Jacksoncole, I am a consulting auditor with one of the prime banks here in South Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my client bank who perished with his whole families on 25TH JULY,2000 in CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight AF4590] with the whole passengers on board. During the course of my auditing work with my client bank, I discovered an account opened in the bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account. Since his death, I further investigated with keen interest to see if i can get any relative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of his company. The total amount involved is $36,000,000.00 USD.[Thirty Six Million United States Dollar]. We wish to start the first transfer with $10,000,000.00[Ten million] and upon successful transaction without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.I have secretly discussed this matter with a close confidant attorney whom I must involve in order to assist us produce legal back-up documents which would substantiate your claims and also enable us have a smooth and successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate. On this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing his/her bank account where the fund will be transferred. The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of dormancy. In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount in his or her personal account. At the conclusion of the transfer 65% of the fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process. Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a detailed information about the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased. When you receive this letter. I look forward to your earliest reply through my private email address <mailto:mrp_jack@myway.com or pauljacksoncole@yahoo.com> and telephone number +874 763 593 620. Fax number +874 763 593 621.Just add your international dial out code number and you will get through.You should also include your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe communication.

"Dear Sir/Madam, My name is Mr. Jenif Davix, I work as the operational manager in account management section in charge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a Balance Of US$48,223,000. 00 (Forty eight million two hundred and twenty three thousand U.S dollar).On further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has died long ago with his family on a fatal Auto-accident leaving no beneficiary to the account and no other person knows about this account. I am in close contact with the manager of the bank here who is my partner and he is willing to approve the transfer to any reliable and trustworthy foreigner with foreign bank account because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner and from Australia in particular.  I am certainly sure that he has no writen or oral WILL attached to the account , no beneficiary and nobody will come again for the claim of this money. It is only a foreigner who can claim this money with legal claims to the account holder which I will provide to you if you are interested, therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. The difference in country of origins is not a hindrance to the success of this transaction. This money will remain useless in this dormant account if I did not transfer the fund out to a foreign account. I will provide the necessary information and documents needed in order to claim this money. I only need your cooperation as a foreigner to provide your safe bank account information for the transfer. All arrangement that will ensure a smooth transfer of the fund to the account which you are to nominate is already in place.You should also provide me with your direct phone lines for easy communication. I wish for utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction. At the conclussion of this transaction, your share will be 25% of the total transfer sum, 70% for me and my partner while 5% will be set aside for any expenses both parties might incure during the process of the transfer. The fund will be transferred to your account in two parts. I will first transfer USD 20 Million to your account. I will fly over to meet you after the successful transfer for sharing according to the agreed percentages. I will  have the remaining balance  of USD28,223 Million transferred to your account only after the successful sharing of the first transfer without any disappointment from your side. Have a nice day as I entrust this transfer into your hands.

"purely on the personal conviction of trust and confidence that we can co-operate with each other and do a very lucrative business for our mutual benefits. I want you to give me the needed assistance by allowing me to present you as the next of kin to the deceased and the beneficiary to his estate. The deceased had a deposit valued presently at ($40,800,000.00) and his Bank has issued me a notice to provide his next of kin or beneficiary by will, otherwise the account would be confiscated.  Already, i have marked out modalities for achieving my aim of appointing a next of kin as well as transfer the money out of this country, for us to share the money in the ratio of 53% for me and 35% to you, The 2% of the fund will serve as reimbursement of expenses both local and international any of us will make in the course of this transaction. While we shall collectively donate the remaining balance of 10% to Charity homes Organizations.  It is my intention to achieve this transfer in a legitimate way, all i required is your honest co-operation, confidentiality and trust to enable us see this transaction through. This is a very legal business that I am very sure of its success and is absolutely risk free.  If this proposal is acceptable to you, kindly email following informations to me; 1.

Below and attached is a proposed draft for a speech next Thursday at CFR. You'll recall that we discussed this with youat the last speech meeting. The idea is to give a speech one year after your last CFR address that updates and amplifiesthe frame you outlined and fills it in with the work of the past year. The speech will also underscore the continuitybetween your speech and the National Security Strategy.The below draft still needs a good bit of work but we have between now and next Thursday to get it into shape. AMSwas initially skeptical but I think she believes the speech is heading in the right direction (she'll write you with specificcomments ... I have my own suggestions for further improvement) and that on balance it should be given. Derek is astrong proponent of the speech and Jim who has not read a draft embraced the concept.***DRAFT***SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON REMARKS AT COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS WASHINGTON DCJULY 15 2010B5B5B5B5B-Thank you.###
"SULE OKETAYO EAGLE BANK PLC suleoketayo@alexandria.cc  Dear Sir/Madam, I am Sule Oketayo, the head of the Treasury Department of Foreign Operations Eagle Bank PLC of Nigeria. In my department, I discovered an abandoned sum of US$13,500,000.00  (Thirteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account belonging to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in 1998 in an auto crash. This account was open with the bank in 1993 and since 1998 nobody has operated it. After careful investigation, I discovered that the owner of this account was the president of   MIRA CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LTD. Despite several attempts by the bank to trace the relativesext of kin of the deceased, up to date nobody has yet come forward to claim the money.I later discovered that all his supposed next of kin died with him in the auto crash incident. I have spent the last five years monitoring the account and gathering necessary information and documents on it. Now that all papers are ready, I am asking for your assistant to release the money to you as next of kin or relation to the deceased for safekeeping and subsequent sharing.  The banking laws of Nigeria stipulates that such money, if unclaimed after five years of maturity, will be transferred into the Central Bank treasury as unclaimed effect. The request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and presenting a Nigerian as the next of kin to a foreigner could raise concerns from the bank management. I am ready to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. 10% will be used to pay off all the necessary fees/charges involved in the transfer. 25% will go to two other officials of Eagle Bank that are with me in this and whose positions will greatly help in expediting the transfer. I will be taking 45%. Please note that these figures are negotiable. After the money has been transferred to your country, I will visit your country for the disbursement/investing of my share according to the percentages we agree upon. Note this transaction requires utmost confidentiality and I am assuring you that it is 100% risk-free so you need not be afraid. I will not contact any other person until I am convinced that you are not interested. Can you please send me your phone and fax number for safer communication when needed. Also please kindly note that all the money to finance this transfer will be provided and you will not be asked to contribute anything. When I hear from you, I will send you an online banking access code with which you can log in to verify the account and balance using the banks online banking website.Best Regards,Sule Oketayosoketayo@alexandria.cc"
"     (URGENT TRANSFER)        Good Day My Dear,We want to transfer to overseas the sum of One hundred and Forfty TwoMillion United States Dollars (U.S.$142,000,000.00) from a in Africa.I want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and honest person who wil=lbe capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set u=pa new bank account immediately to receive this  oney,though an empty bankaccount could serve this purpose as long as you will remain honest to metill the end of this important business trusting in you and believing inGod that you will never let me down either now or in time to come.I am Mr.Sam White ,the external auditor of a Bank.During the course of ou=rauditing,I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this account again.After goingthrough some old files in the records, I discovered that the owner of theaccount died without a Heir apparent to the throne hence the money isfloating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will beforfeited for nothing.The owner of this account who is Mr.Eshed.B.Willey,a foreigner and anindustrialist died, since 1990,until now no other person(s) knows aboutthis account or could give any documentary evidence concerning thisaccount. As such this account has no other beneficiary and myinvestigation proved to me as well that Eshed.B.Willey until his death wa=sthe manager Oriental Diamond Company,in South Africa. However, if you areinterested in this business we will start the first money transfer withForfty Two MillionU.S.Dollars (U.S.$42,000,000.00) upon successful transaction without anydisappointment from you. We shall also re-apply for the payment of theremaining amount to your account.While the total amount involved is One hundred and Forfty Two MillionUnited States Dollars (U.S.$142000,000.00)only. I would want us to make afirst transfer of Forfty Two Million United StatesDollar.(U.S.$4200,000.00)from this money into a safe foreigners accountabroad before the rest. I am only contacting you as a foreigner becausethis money can not be approved to a local account, without valid"

Let's be conservative here and assume that you rec=eive only an average response rate of 12.5%.=20If you send out your email to 40 different people, you can expect at leas=t 5 of those people to do exactly what you did (12.5% of 40 =3D 5). By th=is time, your email address will have moved up to No 4 in the list, and t=his list will now have reached around 200 people (5 x 40).=20Out of those 200 people, you can expect at least 25 of them to participat=e (12.5% of 200 =3D 25), so that's a further 1,000 emails (25 x 40) being= sent out and your email address will have risen to No 3 in the list.=20Out of those 1,000 people, you can expect at least 125 of them to partici=pate (12.5% of 1,000 =3D 125), so that's a further 5,000 emails (125 x 40=) being sent out with you now at the No 2 position.=20Out of those 5,000 people, you can expect at least 625 of them to respond= (12.5% of 5,000 =3D 625), so that's 25,000 emails (625 x 40) being sent =out with YOUR ADDRESS at the No 1 spot!=20Now, out of those 25,000 people, you can expect around 3,125 of them to r=espond (12.5% of 25,000 =3D 3,125). And since you will now be at No 1 in =the list, you will receive =A33 (=805/$5) from each of them, that's; =A39=,375 (3,125 x =A33(=805/$5).=20So, when your name starts to hit the No 1 position within the next few da=ys, it will be YOUR turn to collect the money! Over the course of 30 days= the money will be sent to you, by a few thousand people just like yourse=lf. The first payments will arrive within a few days, and they will conti=nue at the rate of about 100 payments per day for about 30 days. After th=at time, the volume of payments begins to taper off as your e-mail addres=s vacates the No 1 position.=20"

I am genuine and my attorney will prove it to you once he hear from you.Please help me out in this my condition. I believe you are a highly respected personality,considering the fact that I sourced your profile from a human resourceprofile database on your country in the Internet.Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in Liberia but it has formed consistent headlines in the CNN, BBC news bulletins.My Name is MRS.SUZANA NUHAN VAYE from Liberia,a Country in West Africa. My late Husband is Issac Nuhan Vaye, Deputy Minister of Publ ic Works in Liberia. My Husband was falsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA CHARLES TAYLOR) from office.Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him. You can verify this from some of the international newspapers posted in the web sites below:(I)http://www.usatoday.comews/world/2003-07-15-liberia_x.htmBefore my husband was killed, he moved out the sum of $21.5 million through a diplomatic means, and deposited it with a Security Company Abroad. And this money was meant for importation of agriculturalmachinery."

"Dearerst,I MAKE THIS APPEAL WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ANY FACTS OR OPINION EXPRESSED BY ME ARE GIVING IN CONFIDENCE AND SOLELY FOR YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.I am DR.AME BENJAMIN,the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department  Bank of africa burkinafaso.In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of US$8.5M, (Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with account number 14-2558-5976that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which crashed on 31 January, 2000. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this website:http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/The Owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great industrialist and a resident of Alaska.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to release the money to you.You have to follow the instruction which I will be send to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety andsubsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after Three years, the money will be transfered into the banktreasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than three years and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has beentransfered to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only that will know that the money is not transfered into our treasure.This request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabï¿½ cannot standas next of kin to a foreigner.In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you 30% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to be incurred during the course of transaction, while the remaining 65% is for me.Upon receipt of your reply,i will send to you by fax or email the text of the application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr;Morris Thomson.

FYI -- Karl and Zakhilwal have gone to Islamabad to try to close the deal.
FYI below on French statement on Haiti and U.S. support:Paris January 19 2010COMMUNIQUEDuring their telephone conversation last week the President of the Republic and President Obama expressed theresolute commitment of our two countries in Haiti and decided to combine their efforts in order to deal with the urgenthumanitarian situation and to respond in the future to the enormous reconstruction requirements.The French authorities have since then been entirely satisfied with the cooperation between our two countries andbeyond that the continuous coordination between the Crises Centers of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairsand the U.S. Department of State. They want to pay tribute to the United States' extraordinary mobilization efforts insupport of Haiti and the vital role it is playing on the ground.
"Kindest Attention:My name is Mr. Dave Benton, I am from Portugal .  I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself)but my business.  Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I  cared for.But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few close friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have Distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of  my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I  have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Thirty  Million United States Dollars($30,000,000,00) that I have with an Asset Management Company Abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations.N/B:Kindly note that  35% of this funds must go to the tsunami victims,60% to other Charity Organization and 5%  for your effort and time.I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am using my Lab Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond to this e-mail if you are interested in carrying out this assignment on my behalf.God be with you.Mr. Dave Benton, "

"Dear Friend.Attention Please,I am Georg Path, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.The said amount was U.S 18.4M (Eighteen Million,Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and internet bills, while 50% will be for me.  Please, you have been adviced to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when I hear from you.I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,Yours faithfully,George Path."

"       Attorneys/Legal Practitioner,       Nigeria.Dear Beloved,Compliments of the season. Grace and peace and love from this part of the Atlantic to you. I hope my letter does not cause you too much embarrassment as I write to you in good faith based on the contact address given to me by a friend who works at the Nigerian embassy in your country. Please excuse myintrusion into your private life.I am Barrister Isa Usman I represent Mohammed Abacha, son of the late Gen. Sani Abacha, who was the former military head of state in Nigeria, he died in 1998 since his death the family has been losing a lot of money due to vindictive government officials who are bent on dealing with the family. Based on this therefore, the family has asked me to seek for a foreign partner who can work with us as to move out the total sum of US$75,000,000.00 (Seventy Five Million United States Dollars), presently in their possession. this money was of course, acquired by the late president and is now kept secretly by the family.The Swiss government has already frozen all the accounts of the family in Switzerland, and some other countries would soon follow to do the same. This bid by some government officials to deal with this family has made it necessary that we seek your assistance in receiving this money and in investing it on behalf of the family.This must be a joint venture transaction and we must all work together since this money is still cash, extra security measures have been taken to protect it from theft or seizure, pending when agreement is reached on when and how to move it into any of your nominated bank accounts. I have personally worked out all modalities for the peaceful conclusion of thistransaction. The transaction definitely would be handled in phases and the first phase will involve the moving of US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five Million United States Dollars).My clients are willing to give you a reasonable percentage of this money as soon as the transaction is concluded. I will, however, based on the grounds that you are willing to work with us and also all contentious issues discussed before the commencement of this transaction. You may also discuss your percentage before we start to work, as soon as I hear from you, I will give you all necessary details as to how we intend to carry out the whole transaction.Please, do not entertain any fear, as all necessary modalities are in place, and I assure you of all success and safety in this transaction.Please, this transaction requires absolute confidentiality and you would be expected to treat it as such until the funds are moved out of this country."
"The unsigned editorials will appear in all of Bloomberg's online and print media properties â including BloombergBusinessweek Bloomberg.corn and the nearly 300000 financial data terminals leased to Wall Street traders andbusinesses around the world. It will be run by two distinguished voices: James P. Rubin a former assistant secretary ofstate under Bill Clinton and David Shipley editor of The New York Times Op-Ed page.gotDecember 15 2010loomberg to Publish EditorialsBy IERE-:EviY PE.TEP.SBeing mayor of New York City would be a large enough platform for just about anyone. But apparently not for Michael R.The mayor's company 3loomber3 L.P. said on Wednesday that it would begin publishing editorials across its vast mediaenterprise in an effort to broaden the company's influence on national affairs. And though Mr. Bloomberg has anagreement with the city to have no involvement in the ""day-to-day operations"" of his company the endeavor calledBloomberg View is intended to channel his personal philosophy and worldview.""I think it's very important that everyone understands that our editorial page is going to be for sure consistent with thevalues and beliefs of the founder â even if he happens to be mayor of New York City"" said Matthew Winkler the editor inchief of Bloomberg News. ""I fully expect us in our Bloomberg View always to reflect those values. In fact I want people tocome away from reading the Bloomberg View infused with those beliefs and values.""The effort presents a host of conflict-of-interest questions for the mayor. The new venture provides the mayor with yetanother potent communications apparatus â one that carries his name and imprimatur â to sound off on issues thatcollide with his job as mayor his corporate interests and his expanding philanthropic empire.Bloomberg L.P. executives said they would not shy away from publishing editorials on issues in which Mr. Bloomberg hasa direct interest as mayor like education public health and environmental policy. Mr. Winkler said the editorials would notavoid such issues but would disclose the mayor's involvement when warranted.Though Mr. Bloomberg will not have a hand in conceiving and writing the editorials he is likely to offer feedback from timeto time before they are published Mr. Winkler said.""I think that there's a very good chance that's going to happen"" he said referring to Mr. Bloomberg's occasionalinvolvement. It is unclear whether that level of involvement is permitted under his agreement with the city to remain atarm's length from the company.A spokesman for the mayor Stu Loeser said the mayor was allowed limited involvement in his agreement with the city.""Weighing in from time to time is consistent with his being the majority shareholder of the company he founded"" he said.As someone whose presidential ambitions are the source of endless speculation acquiring the platform of an editorialpage is certain to draw more attention to Mr. Bloomberg's plans. (On Sunday Mr. Bloomberg ruled out a run forpresident.)The unsigned editorials will appear in all of Bloomberg's online and print media properties â including BloombergBusinessweek Bloomberg.com and the nearly 300000 financial data terminals leased to Wall Street traders andbusinesses around the world. It will be run by two distinguished voices: James P. Rubin a former assistant secretary ofstate under Bill Clinton and David Shipley editor of The New York Times Op-Ed page.Opinion and commentary have not typically been areas of focus for Bloomberg with its just-the-facts approach. In factthe mayor has complained about the corrosive effect of the 24-hour news cycle and overheated political commentary inthe blogosphere.But company leaders including Mr. Bloomberg who has been aware of the project since it was conceived more than twoyears ago saw an opportunity to extend their influence.For a firm that has made no secret of its ambitions to become the most influential media company in the world starting aneditorial operation is the latest effort to propel it beyond its core mission as a financial news service.The notion of media barons using editorials to shape public opinion and policy according to their personal views is an oldone in American journalism. William Randolph Hearst for example often wrote front-page editorials for his newspapers.Mr. Bloomberg it would seem is casting himself in that mold though there are no plans for him to begin writing signededitorials. For now he is content letting his trusted deputies speak for him.""He's accepting and embracing the privilege of a media mogul"" said David Nasaw a professor of history at the CityUniversity of New York Graduate Center who wrote a biography of Hearst. ""This is what we all do. We try to persuade therest of the world we are right. Of course we don't have the vehicles to do so. The rich have the vehicles to do so.""Mr. Winkler said: ""There's a huge opportunity here for Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg News to seize the day literallyseize the day by bringing wisdom to events as they unfold. And one can't always do that with the best result withreporting.""""That certainly is a benefit to the founder of the company the man. But it is also a huge opportunity for Bloomberg thecompany that it should take advantage of"" Mr. Winkler added.Bloomberg L.P. acquired BusinessWeek last year giving the 29-year-old company a print product with a long legacy ofaccomplishment.Bloomberg is in the midst of an expansion in Washington. With a service called Bloomberg Government an operation thatwill eventually employ 300 journalists and analysts the company will sell for $5700 a year information about governmentservices and contracts to lobbyists and others with business interests in the nation's capital."

"Barack Obama rebuffs Gordon Brown as 'specialrelationship' sinks to new lowGordon Brown has been snubbed repeatedly by Barack Obamaduring his trip to the United States as the fall-out from the release ofthe Lockerbie bomber appeared to have left ""the special relationship""at its lowest ebb for nearly 20 years.By Andrew Porter Political Editor in New YorkPublished: 11:49PM BST 23 Sep 2009British officials made five attempts to secure official talks with the US President and even agreed to a policychange in an attempt to land a joint appearance between the two leaders said diplomatic sources.But the White House rebuffed the offers and Mr Brown who had hoped to increase his popularity by appearingon his own with Mr Obama had to settle instead for a snatched conversation with the President in a New Yorkkitchen.The setbacks led to fears that relati ons between Downing Street and the White House were at their lowest pointsince John Major's frosty dealings with Bill Clinton.It was disclosed earlier this week that Mr Brown would not hold bilateral talks with Mr Obama despite thePresident hosting individual meetings with the leaders of Japan China and Russia. Downing Street claimed thatthis was not unusual.However a British diplomat told The Daily Telegraph that the White House's refusal to meet Mr Brown hadbeen a serious embarrassment for the Prime Minister.""It is wrong for people to say that we have been relaxed about the way things have gone"" the source said.""There were five attempts to set up a meeting and none have come off.""The most striking example of Downing Street's desperation to engineer a meeting was a change of policy onsupplying swine flu vaccines to Africa. It aimed to match America's commitment and was announced last week.As a result it had been hoped that Mr Obama would agree to a joint press conference according to a seniorsource. However the meeting never happened.The White House said that Mr Brown and Mr Obama would chair a meeting tonight about Pakistan and would""spend all day Friday together."" However Friday's meeting in Pittsburgh involves the full G20 group of worldleaders.The release=2 Oof the Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi appears to have been behind thenew chill in relations between Washington and London.Mr Obama expressed his dismay at the release in a telephone call with the Prime Minister earlier this month.Downing Street's original account of the conversation failed to refer to the President's anger.Mr Brown has maintained that freeing the Libyan was a matter entirely for the Scottish executive.Nearly 200 Americans died when Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Scotland in 1988. Yesterday familiesof victims protested at the UN in New York where Mr Brown and Libya's leader Col Muammar Gaddafi madespeeches.Last night Downing Street played down suggestions of a rift with the White House and pointed to an informaldiscussion that Mr Brown had with Mr Obama after a climate change dinner at the UN on Tuesday night. The15-minute ""walk and chat"" took place in a kitchen of the UN headquarters as both men left the building inManhattan.No 10 maintained that there was nothing unusual in the Prime Minister not holding a separate ""bilateral""meeting with the President. There was little doubt that Mr Brown would have relished a high profile meetingwith Mr Obama.In a speech to the United Nations Mr Obama said the world must ""move in a new direction"" and ""embrace20anew era of engagement"". That was seen as a sign that the President was more likely to place emphasis onrelations with a wide range of countries rather than rely on old alliances. Mr Brown's increasingly poorrelationship with the White House contrasts sharply with that of his predecessor Tony Blair who enjoyed closefriendships with both Mr Clinton and George W Bush.John Major's Tory government had difficulty with Mr Clinton however because of claims that Mr Major hadtried to help George Bush Snr's re-election campaign in 1992 by allowing researchers to dig into Mr Clinton'sstudent past at Oxford â something Sir John has always denied.Mr Brown whose plans for a lunchtime speech to the United Nations were derailed after Col Gaddafi spoke for96 minutes faced attacks on several fronts yesterday.Kathy Tedeschi and Sue Kosmowski Americans who lost husbands in the Lockerbie bombing travelled toNew York to protest outside the UN headquarters. They claimed that Mr Brown had put trade interests ahead ofjustice for victims families.The Prime Minister was also accused of trying to appease Iran by ignoring the supression of opposition in orderto safeguard talks on its nuclear programme.Shirin Ebadi Iran's only Nobel Peace Prize winner said the West cared more about its own securit y thanhuman rights.Mr Brown was criticised for failing to stay at a dinner where he was honoured as Statesman of the Year. Guestspaid $1000 to attend the function attended by among others Henry Kissinger and the pop star Bono."

"so .  Dear Friend, I Am The Manager Of Foreign Remittance And Exchange Dept= At African Development Bank (ADB). Burkina- Faso, West Africa . In my depa=rtment we discover an abandoned sum of Usd$12.6m Dollars (Twelve Million, S=ix Hundred Thousand Us Dollar). In an account that belongs to one of our fo=reign customer who died alongside with his entire family in a plane crash t=he year 2001 that took the whole life of the passengers on board. Since we =got information about his death, the bank have been expecting his next of k=in to come over and claim his money because the bank cannot release it unle=ss someone applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as ind=icating in our banking guideline, but unfortunately we learnt that all his =supposed next of kin or relation that knows about the account information d=ied alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the cla=im.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this busi=ness proposal to you and for the money to be release to you as the next of =kin or relation to the deceased, since nobody will ever come for it, we do =not want this money to go into the treasury of the bank as unclaimed bill o=r fund. The bank law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remai=ned unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank =treasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin= in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a fore=igner and a citizen cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.In subsequen=t disbursement of the money, I agree that 40% of this money will be for you= in respect of the provision you made by standing in the claim as next of k=in,10% will be set aside for expenses in cure during  the transaction on ta=xes that will arise and 50% would be for me.As soon as the money hit into y=our account I will come over to your country for disbursement according to =the percentages indicated above. To make the claim, you will first of all a=pply to the bank by sending a text of application which I will send to you =for you to fill and send to the bank. In the application you will indicate =your bank account, your private fax and your private telephone number for e=asy and effective communication. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to= you by email the text of application which you will send to the bank. I wi=ll not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and= you do not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have be=en made for the success of the transfer. You should contact me immediately =as soon as you receive this letter. Hoping to hear from you immediately.

"Greetings,  My name is RABI AL SALIH, wife of MAHAMMED MAHDI AL SALIH, the former Iraqi minister for Interior Affairs. I got your email address through the internet while searching for a reliable person to help me and I believe you can be able to help me and my family. My husband was captured on 23 April 2003 by the US forces. My husband is presently in jail and facing trial on charges of terrorism, corruption, embezzlement and the mysterious charge of plunder which might lead to death sentence. During my husband's regime as Minister for Interior, I realized some reasonable amount of money from various deals that I successfully executed. I have plans to invest this money for my children's future on real estate and industrial production. My husband is not aware of this because I wish to do it secretly for now.  Before the US invaded our nation, I secretly siphoned the sum of $12,000,000 million USD out of Iraq and deposited the money with a security firm that transports valuable goods and consignments through diplomatic means. I also declared that the consignment was solid gold belonging to my foreign business partner. I am contacting you because I want you to go to the security company and claim the money on my behalf since I have declared that the consignment belong to my foreign business partner. You shall also be required to assist me in investment in your country.  I trust you as a reliable person who will not sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me properly I expect you to declare what percentage of the total money you will take for your assistance. when I receive your positve response I will give you all the necessary informations to enable you proceed to the security company and claim the money. I shall also let you know where the security company is and the consignment pin code to claim the consignment, which is very important. I assure you 100% safety and success once you follow my instructions. For now, let all our communication be by e-mail because my line are tight now connected to the US Forces Telecomunication Network services. Please also send me your telephone and fax number. I will give more details when I receive your reply. Yours Sincerely,Rabi.		"

BOX 1596ALBERTON BRANCH DURBAN 4000 SOUTH AFRICA.EMAIL ga_m@epatra.com dear,I humbly wish to seek your assistance in a matter that is very important and needs utmost trust and confidence. I am MR Gabriel Mukanabe THE ASSISTANT TO THE AUDITOR GENERAL AMALGAMATED BANKS OF SOUTH AFRICA (ABSA) and a close confidant of one of the South-African most powerful family. The wife of former top Government official, a Gold magnet {OriginalOwner of GRUGGER GOLD CO.}, i.e. late Dr BAMUNGA SANGO MBEKI, former Junior Minister of Mines and Power , Republic ofSouth-Africa.Unfortunately, he died of heart attack soon after handing over because the new Government wanted to probe his activitieswhile in office for financial misappropriations. Presently, all their foreign and local count was frozen and their assets confiscated. The wife, who is now on her sick bed helplessly since her husbands death with her only son to look after, wishes to move out of South-Africa the sum of USD$75 million . She wishes to invest the a for mentioned sum on real estate property/viable inves!tments overseas. For obvious reasons, my client does not want to place this fund with established financial institution with the family name forsecurity reasons. It is her desire that the deal be handled as quietly as possible without possibility of any leakage to the public or Government. She has therefore empowered me to find and negotiate for a reliable and trustworthy foreigner who can assist us by using his/her name in moving the money to a foreign safe account and who can assist to invest the fund properly for the family. If you agree to act as a fund manager for my client and the family, I shall release the sum of $75 USD[seventy five million united states dollars] to you if you meet my requirements.The money is available safe with a private security company coded and lodged in with a fictitious name. Upon a favorable response from you, I shall let you know the steps involve. Your commission shall be down payment of 25% of the total sum, and annual 10% of the after ta!x returns on investment for the first 5 years. Thereafter, the terms shall be re-negotiated. If you are capable and willing to participate in this transaction contact me through ga_m@epatra.com IF FOR ANY REASON YOU ARE NOT DISPOSED AT MOMENT TO UNDERTAKE THIS DEAL,LET ME KNOW ON TIME SO AS TO MAKE ALTERNATIVEARRANGEMENT.BECAUSE I WILL NOT CONACT ANOTHER PERSON UNTILL I HEAR FROM YOU.Yours faithfully,MR Gabriel Mukanabe______________________________________________________Get Paid...

"sbwhoeopSaturday October 9 2010 10:50 AMH: Dems should demand Boehner remove this GOP Nazi reenactor. Put Boehner in thisblitzkrieg. SidWhy is This GOP House Candidate Dressed asa Nazi?By Joshua GreenAn election year already notable for its menagerie of extreme and unusual candidates can add another one: Rich lott theRepublican nominee for Congress from Ohio's 9th District and a Tea Party favorite who for years donned a GermanWaffen SS uniform and participated in Nazi re-enactments.Rich lott second from right in a Nazi SS Waffen uniform.lott whose district lies in Northwest Ohio was involved with a group that calls itself Wiking whose members are devotedto re-enacting the exploits of an actual Nazi division the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking which fought mainly on theEastern Front during World War 11. lott's participation in the Wiking group is not mentioned on his campaign's website andhis name and photographs were removed from the Wiking website.When contacted by The Atlantic lott confirmed hisinvolvement with the group over a number of years but said his interest in Nazi Germany was historical and he does notsubscribe to the tenets of Nazism. ""No absolutely not"" he said. ""In fact there's a disclaimer on the [Wiking] website. Andyou'll find that on almost any reenactment website. it's purely historical interest in World War II.""Rich lott and his wife as shown on his campaign website.lott a member of the Ohio Military Reserve added ""I've always been fascinated by the fact that here was a relativelysmall country that from a strictly military point of view accomplished incredible things. I mean they took over most ofEurope and Russia and it really took the combined effort of the free world to defeat them. From a purely historical militarypoint of view that's incredible.""lott says the group chose the Wiking division in part because it fought on the Eastern Front mainly against the RussianArmy and not U.S. or British soldiers. The group's website includes a lengthy history of the Wiking unit a recruitmentvideo and footage of goose-stepping German soldiers marching in the Warsaw victory parade after Poland fell in 1939.The website makes scant mention of the atrocities committed by the Waffen SS and includes only a glancing reference tothe ""twisted"" nature of Nazism. Instead it emphasizes how the Wiking unit fought Bolshevist Communism:Nazi Germany had no problem in recruiting the multitudes of volunteers willing to lay down their lives toensure a ""New and Free Europe"" free of the threat of Communism. National Socialism was seen by -many in Holland Denmark Norway Finland and other eastern European and Balkan countries as theprotector of personal freedom and their very way of life despite the true underlying totalitarian (and quitetwisted in most cases) nature of the movement. Regardless thousands upon thousands of valiant mendied defending their respective countries in the name of a better tomorrow. We salute these idealists; nomatter how unsavory the Nazi government was the front-line soldiers of the Waffen-SS (in particular theforeign volunteers) gave their lives for their loved ones and a basic desire to be free.Historians of Nazi Germany vehemently dispute this characterization. ""These guys don't know their history"" said CharlesW. Sydnor Jr. a retired history professor and author of ""Soldiers of Destruction: The SS Death's Head Division 1933-45""which chronicles an SS division. ""They have a sanitized romanticized view of what occurred."" Sydnor added that re-enactments like the Wiking group's are illegal in Germany and Austria. ""If you were to put on an SS uniform in Germanytoday you'd be arrested.""See web-only content:http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/why-is-this-gop-house-candidate-dressed-as-a-nazi/64319/Christopher Browning a professor of history at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill said ""It is so unhistorical andso apologetic that you don't know to what degree they've simply caught up innocent war memorabilia enthusiasts wholove putting on uniforms.""loft says he does not recall exactly when he joined the Wiking group (his name appears on a unit roster as far back as2003) but did so with his son ""as a father-son bonding thing."" He says his name and pictures were removed from theWiking website not out of concern that they would harm his political career but because he quit the group three yearsago after his son lost interest.loft participated in the group under his own name and also under the alias ""Reinhard Pferdmann"" which has also beenremoved and which lott described as being his German alter ego. ""Part of the reenactor's [experience]"" lott said ""is theliving-history part of really trying to get into the persona of the time period. In many not just in our unit but in many unitswhat individuals do is create this person largely based on a Germanized version of their name and a history kind of basedaround your own real experiences. 'Reinhard' of course is 'Richard' in German. And 'Pferdmann""pferd' is a horse. So it'sliterally 'horse man.""Asked whether his participation in a Nazi re-enactor's group might not upset voters particularly Jewish voters loft said hehoped it would not: ""They have to take it in context. There's reenactors out there who do everything. You couldn't do CivilWar re-enacting if somebody didn't play the role of the Confederates. [This] is something that's definitely way in the past.... [I hope voters] take it in context and see it for what it is an interest in World War II history. And that's strictly all.""0lott at Nazi re-enactment.Rabbi Moshe Saks of the Congregation B'nai Israel in Sylvania Ohio a suburb of Toledo that sits in the 9th districtdisagreed. ""Any kind of reenactment or glorification of Nazi Germany to us would be something unacceptable andcertainly in poor taste if not offensive"" he said. ""I think the reaction here will be very negative. And not just among theJewish community but the broader community.""In a follow-up email today loft seemed at pains to address concerns that his conduct may have alienated veterans groupsbut made no specific mention of possible offense to Jews or human rights groups: ""Never in any of my reenacting ofmilitary history have I meant any disrespect to anyone who served in our military or anyone who has been affected by thetragedy of war. In fact I have immense respect for veterans who served our country valiantly and my respect of themilitary and our veterans is one of the reasons I have actively studied military history throughout my life."" He added thathe has participated in re-enactments as a Civil War Union infantryman a World War I dough boy and World War IIAmerican infantryman and paratrooper.The actual Wiking unit has a history as grisly as that of other Nazi divisions. In her book ""The Death Marches ofHungarian Jews Through Austria in the Spring of 1945"" Eleonore Lappin the noted Austrian historian writes that soldiersfrom the Wiking division were involved in the killing of Hungarian Jews in March and April 1945 before surrendering toAmerican forces in Austria.""What you often hear is that the [Wiking] division was never formally accused of anything but that's kind of a dodge"" saysProf. Rob Citino of the Military History Center at the University of North Texas who examined the Wiking website. ""Theentire German war effort in the East was a racial crusade to rid the world of 'subhumans' Slays were going to be enslavedin numbers of tens of millions. And of course the multimillion Jewish population of Eastern Europe was going to beexterminated altogether. That's what all these folks were doing in the East. It sends a shiver up my spine to think thatpeople want to dress up and play SS on the weekend.""This article available online at:http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/why-is-this-gop-house-candidate-dressed-as-a-nazi/64319/Copyright Â© 2010 by The Atlantic Monthly Group.

"Dear Friend, I hope this meets you in good health. My name is BarristerPhilip Wilson Esq,legal practitioner and Attorney to late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev who died in the plane crash of Yak-40 jetliner on March 9, 2000. You may follow the Link below to read about the Plane Crash my client lost his life: http://www.amarillonet.com/stories/031500/usn_LA0703.001.shtml, http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/europe/672849.stmMy late client was an influential wealthy businessman, a Contractor in my Country and a Russian big time Oil dealer and the Principal owner of Oil Alliance Company and he left behind a deposit of Twenty Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollar ($25,500,000.00USD) in his domiciliary bank account in a commercial bank here in Ivory Coast. Which is one of the main reasons it has been very important to locate his next of kin.  After the death of my client his bankers contacted me, as his Attorney to provide his next of kin who should inherit his fortune. The board of directors of his bank adopted a resolution and I was mandated to provide his next of kin for the payment of this money or forfeit the money to the bank as an abandoned Estate. The bankers had planned to invoke a clause in the property Act, to confiscate the funds after the expiration of a period given to me. It was while i was searching for his family records on the internet that i came across your contact.I have searched through almost all the genealogy site that you can think of both in the Russia,USA and all the possible places I thought my clients would have possibly had a family member. Despairing and at the point of desperation, I came across your name, while trying to locate documentation's regarding possible relatives of my client in his country of origin. Convinced that you may be able to act in locus for my late client as his next of kin, I therefore, decided to contact you with these facts before me because of the status quo. By virtue of my brief and my closeness to the deceased, I am very much aware of my client's financial standing and the bank account he operates here in my country.  I have reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be legally proper to present you as the next of kin of my deceased client and the sole beneficiary of his estate, so that you are be paid the funds left in his bank account, hence I contacted you. I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin; the bank needs only the facts as presented legally. The rest is between you and I and with my guide we can have the money paid into your account, once this is done we shall both share the funds. 50% to me and 40% to you, while 10% should be for Taxes as your Government may require, I shall assemble all the necessary Legal Documents that will be used to back up our claim. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any Breach of law. Please get in touch with me.Best Regards,Barrister  Philip Wilson"

" I have interest of investing in your country as such I decided to establish contact with you for assistance as soon as I am able to transfer my funds for this investment, which is already with a Security Company in Europe.There are two basic things I would want you to assist me in; (1) Helping me as a front to collect these consignment/funds from the security company in Europe. This is because of my inability to   travel out of the country, which I am taking refuge at the moment with my wife and children, which I will explain better to you upon the receipt of your acceptance.(2) Helping me to carry out feasibility study on areas/choice of investment you deem best for me.I retired as financial consultant and was the last personal financial adviser to the ex- head of state before his demise and have no intention of carrying out any further investment programmed in my country for security reasons.

I was very fortune to meet the deceased file when i was arranging the old and abandoned customers files of 2000-2001 in other to submit to the bank managements accordingly for documentation purposes. Following our banking financial policy, it was obviously indicated and signed law fully that if such money remains unclaimed after five years without somebody been a foreigner apply and claim the fund as the next of kin , the money will be transferred into the Bank Treasury as an unclaimed fund.So the request of you as a foreigner is necessarily needed for the claim because a citizen of Burkina Faso cannot come forward to claim the fund since the law does not permit an indigene to claim such fund Since the real beneficary of the fund is died , the bank are expecting the next of kin to apply for the release of the fund for him or her without delay but unfortunately i learnt through the investigations which I carried out that there is nobody behind who can come and claim the fund.Therefore I want you to apply to the bank with your reliable bank account details where our bank will transfer the fund into and immediately the fund is transferred into your account ,i will share the fund according to the percentage indicated below.SIXTY PERCENT (60%) of the total fund will be for me.THIRTY PERCENT( 30%) for you in provision of the Bank account.FIVE PERCENT(5%) will be for unexpected expenses which may occur during the transfer.FIVE PERCENT(5%) will be preserved for helping the helpless people, like charity organization and motherless babies.Thereafter you will help me to visit your country for sharing the money according to the percentage indicated above.And for the immediate transfer of this fund into your bank account as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as the only existing next of kin to the deceased customer and after approval which will take place immediately as you applied, the transfer of the fund into your nominated bank account will proceed. Please note that you should keep this business secret until you confirm the transfer into the bank account which you will provide. And there is NO RISK in this business. The bank will forward to you all necessary documents related to the transfer and which will prove that you make a legal claim of inheritance.It is true that i pray to GOD before i was pushed forward to contact you for this business but i want you to assure me solemnly that you are a trsutwothy,reliable,honest and capable to avoid cheating me in this business.If you are really sure of your integerity, Reply immediatelly you receive this mail and call me on 00226 76 40 64 06  for more detailed information on how the process to transfer the fund into your account will be.Yours faithfully,Mr Raj Mohammed._________________________________________________________________Windows Live Mail : dï¿½couvrez et testez la version bï¿½ta ! http://www.ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=5d21c51a-b161-4314-9b0e-4911fb2b2e6d"
"sbwhoeoPThursday November 5 2009 12:28 AMHFYI: Decline and Fall of the British Empire 2009 edition. SidFrance: 'Autistic Tories have castrated UK inEurope'French Europe minister says David Cameron's pledge to reclaim EU powers is 'pathetic' and will leave Britain isolatedNicholas'Nat Patrick yVintpur and :15;rattori.c.uardiari.;:o.uk Wednesday 4 November 2009 21.30 GMTThe Cohseri?tvea were accused by the French government tonight of ""castrating"" Britain's position within the EU byadopting an ""autistic"" approach that would take Britain off the radar.Speaking to the Guardian Pierre Lellouche France's Europe minister described as ""pathetic"" the Tories' EU plansannounced today warning they would not succeed ""for a minute"".Giving vent to frustration across the EU which has so'far only been expressed in private Lellouche â who said he wasreflecting Nicolas Sarkozy's ""sadness and regret"" â accused William Hague the shadow foreign secretary of a ""bizarreautism"" in their discussions.He said: ""They have one line and they just repeat one line. It is a very bizarre sense of autism.""Lellouche one of the most Anglophile members of Sarkozy's government made his remarkable intervention after DavidCaii.e.con outlined a fresh Tory approach to the EU in the wake of the full ratification of the Lisbon treaty.A future Conservative government would seek to strengthen British sovereignty and repatriate a series of powers Oversocial and employment legislation the Tory leader said.Cameron said he was not seeking an immediate ""bust-up"" with the EU and would allow the repatriation of powersnegotiations to last as long as five years.But that position was not enough for the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan who quit his role as the party's legal affairs spokesmanin Europe saying he intended to fight for referendums to enable Britain to become ""self-governing"".France's centre-right government condemned Cameron's plans saying that they would marginalise Britain within the EU.Abandoning all diplomatic niceties Lellouche said: ""It's pathetic. It's just very sad to see Britain so important in Europejust cutting itself out from the rest and disappearing from the radar map .... This is a culture of opposition ... It is the resultof a long period of opposition. I know they will come back but I hope the trip will be short."" He said Cameron's approachwas in line with the Tories' decision to abandon the main centre-right EPP grouping in the European parliament of whichSarkozy's UMP party is a member.""They are doing what they have done in the European parliament. They have essentially castrated your UK influence inthe European parliament"" he said.Lellouche said he has told Hague personally that his position was a ""waste of time for all of us"".""I have told William Hague: go away for two to three years in your political economic situation you're going to be all byyour self and you'll come back. Go ahead and do it. That is my message to them ... You want to be marginalised? Wellyou go for it. But it's a waste of time for all of us"" the French minister said.Lellouche made clear the Tories had no hope of securing support for their plans. ""It's not going to happen for a minute.Nobody is going to indulge in rewriting [treaties for] many many years. Nobody is going to play with the institutions again.It's going to be take it or leave it and they should be honest and say that"" he said. ""It is a time of tumultuous waters allaround us. Wars terrorism proliferation Afghanistan energy with Russia massive immigration economic crisis. It is timewhen the destiny of Europe is being defined â whether or not we will exist as a third of the world's GDP capable of fightingit out on climate on trade on every ... issue on the surface of the Earth.""We need to be united otherwise we will be wiped out and marginalised. None of us can do it alone. Whether you're bigor small the lessbn is the same. And [Britain's] risk is one of marginalisation. Irrelevance."" He explained: ""Finally we haveinstitutional package but it took 15 years of looking at our navel and getting everybody bored to death with sterile debate"".In a sign of France's determination to resist the Tory plans to opt out of key EU legislation Lellouche warned the Frenchwould attempt to reduce Britain's EU budget rebate which will be up for negotiation during the next parliament.He pointed out that France is a net EU contributor to the tune of â¬5bn (E4.5bn) unlike Britain which receives a rebate.""If we get a government that is ferociously anti European that will vote down this kind of legislation then I think therelationship is going to be very difficult. As we enter the next phase one of the issues we have to discuss midterm is ofcourse finances. France is a net contributor to the tune of â¬5bn a year of which â¬1.5bn is the same as British rebate. Thatshould tell you quite a bit huh?"" he said.Cameron will be angered by the attack and what it implies for Tory relations with the rest of Europe although in the shortterm he will be more concerned to ensure his strategy of abandoning a referendum on the Lisbon treaty does not provokecries of betrayal on his backbenches.Hague reacted to the French criticism by insisting that Lellouche's comments did not represent the true reception of theTories' plans in Europe.""That is not how we are seen across Europe"" he told BBC2's Newsnight adding his party had established good relationswith Sarkozy's party.""1 don't think you will find that's representative of the reaction in Paris or other European capitals"" he added."
"My Dear,I am Mrs Aicha Ahmed, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department Bank Of Africa.In my department we discoveredan abandoned sum of US$14.5M (fourteen million five hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his family in the 2003 in a plane crash.Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guide lines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with himat the plane crash leaving nobody behindfor the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.I agree that 45% of this money will be for you as respect to the provision of a foreign account , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 50% be for me.Thereafter, I will visit your country fordisbursement according to the percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must applyfirst to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be transfer.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail,Trusting to hear from you immediately.Yours faithfully.Mrs Aicha Ahmed."

"We're still pulling material for you but in them meantime i wanted to let you know the following (which I'llsend as full documents later):1)State Department Human Rights Report 2003 discusses the problem of rape in custody in Sri Lanka2) Amnesty International issued a full report on Rape in Sri Lanka in 2002 (with specific cases cited and ageneral discussion of the problem being on the increase)3) UNHCR website has a a page devoted to rape in Sri Lanka and references the Amnesty International Report4)Asia Human Rights Commission issued a report titled: Sri Lanka: Systematic Detention Torture Rape andMurder as Weapon of War (2000)I checked the BCL that came from Melanne's office with this information. It was cleared by JO PRM P D/LD/S AF and assorted others.The problem is that it was not sent to SCA or East Asia and should have been. But the rest of the buildingsigned off on it.Also it is clear that the reference in the Security Council statement referred to rapes in the past.The firstreference is to rape in the DRC and Sudan. Two sentences later we say:""We've seen rape used as a tactic of war before in Bosnia Burma Sri Lanka and elsewhere. ""Can you download these documents if I email them to you? Otherwise I can try to paste them into emails."
"ATTN:Sir/Madam,My name is Mr Michael eze the Manager, Credit and Foreign bills of trust bank of africa limited.I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with accountnumber 14-255-2004/utb/t whose name is Joung Heasook, Korea who perished in a plane crash[Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6,1997.And for your perusal you can view thisweb sitehttp://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.listSince the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched withkeen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of US$25.5M (Twenty Five Million Five Hundred Thoudsand United States Dollars) which has been with my branch for a very long time.On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as theNext of Kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than eight years, because money will be recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period.In view of this i will give you 30% of the total. Upon the receipt ofyour response, I will send you by fax or e-mail the application, bank's fax number and the next step to take.I will not fail to bring to yournotice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the deceased.When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail signifying yourdecision including your private Tel/Fax numbers for quickcommunication.Yours Sincerely,Mr. Michael eze."

"Valenzuela Arturo A <ValenzuelaAA@state.gov>Friday October 1 2010 7:34 AMGonzalez Juan S; Sullivan Jacob J; Abedin Huma; Steinberg James B; Burns William JFrom Arturo - Correa Rescued in EcuadorMadame Secretary: After a tense day in which President Correa was slightly injured at noon by rioting andstriking police and later was barred from leaving the hospital by the same the army finally rescued him at9pm last night. Some military units including the Navy unit in Guayaquil appeared to support the police. Thepolice also occupied the national congress. As the rescue took place the head of the Ecuadoran Joints Chiefsof Staff issued a statement supporting the president and noting that the armed forces respect the rule of law""in which the President [Rafael Correa] is the maximum authority of the three branches."" Things are nowcalm.Reaction in the hemisphere was one of deep concern. The OAS adopted a resolution; South Americanpresidents at the call of UNASUR travelled to Buenos Aires and are likely to go on to Quito to supportCorrea. Several including Garcia and Santos called Correa. Zapatero also spoke with him. Moratinos tried toreach you at around 6pm last evening to convey that news I took the call.As you know we issued a statement of support for Correa. I also gave an interview to CNN in Spanish whichwas re-played frequently. I strongly recommend that you call Correa today to reiterate U.S. support for hisgovernment and to wish him well.He will appreciate it but more broadly it sends a signal that the United States supports the constitutionalorder and rejects any attempt to undermine it. Chavez in Buenos Aires predictably declared that we werebehind the unrest. We have prepared a call sheet for you.RegardsArturo"

"Dear friend,     Greetings to you in the name of our heavenly God.  This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious couldcome into your mind; but please, consider it a divine wish and accept itwith a deep sense of humility.      My name is NELSON  HENRY. Iï¿½m a 65 years old man.  I am British living in Trinidad and tobago(south america).   I was a merchant and owned two businesses in Kuala lumpur,(Malaysia).  I was also married with two children.  My wife and two children died in a car accident three years ago.   Before this happened my business and concern for making money was all I lived for.  I never really cared about other values in life.   But since the loss of my family, I have found a new desire toassist helpless families.      I have been helping orphans in orphanage/ motherless homes.     I have donated some money to orphans in Sudan, South Africa,Cameroon, Brazil, Spain, Austria, Germany and some Asian countries.  Before I became ill, I kept $15 Million in a long-term deposit account in aFinance/Secutity company.      Presently, Iï¿½m in a hospital where I have been undergoing  treatment for esophageal cancer.     I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctorshave told me that I have only a few months to live. It is my last wishto see this money distributed to charity organizations.  Because relativesand friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannotlive with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them.     Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me collect the deposit andthe interest accrued from the company.      Distributes it amongst charity organizations.     Use your judgment to distribute the money and feel free to reimburseyourself when you have the money for any cost you incure during theprocess of collecting and distributing the money to charity organizations. .     Iï¿½m willing to offer you a ! Reward if you are willing to help; pleasereply as soon as you can.     May the good Lord bless you and your family.  Regards.

With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.The said amount was U.S 18.4M (Eighteen Million,Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and internet bills, while 50% will be for me.  Please, you have been adviced to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in.

"Dear Friend,My name is JANG DOO-HWAN, The brother of Mr. CHUNDOO-HWAN, the former President of South Korea whoseized power in a military coup in 1979 and who ruledfrom 1979 to 1987. My brother was pushed out of officeand charged with treason, corruption and embezzlementof over 21 billion won. He was wrongly sentenced todeath but fortunately AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL stepped inand commuted the sentence to life. We thank God thathe has finally been released though still under housearrest in the sense of the conditions of his freedom.During my brother's regime as president of SouthKorea, we realized some reasonable amount of moneyfrom various deals that we successfully executed. Ihave plans to invest this money for my children=92sfuture in real estate and industrial production.Before my brother was overthrown, I secretlysiphoned the sum of $20,000,000.00 Million USD (TwentyMillion United States dollars) out of Seoul anddeposited the money with a Security Firm thattransports valuable goods and consignments throughdiplomatic means.I am contacting you because I want you to deal withthe Security Firm and claim the money on my behalfsince I have declared that the consignment belong tomy Foreign Business Partner. You shall also berequired to assist me in investments in your country.I hope to trust you as a God fearing person who willnot sit on this money when you claim it, rather youwould assist me properly.I intend to give you 20% of the total money if you can assist me claim these from the security company.When Ireceive your positive response I will let you know where the Security Firm is and the Payment Pin Code to claim the money which is very important. What I need is for you to indicate your interest that you will assist me by receiving the money on my behalf in Europe. For this, you shall be considered to be the beneficiary of the money. The project in brief, is that the funds with which we intend to carry out our proposed investments in your country, is presently in the custody of a Diplomatic Courier Service Companyin Europe.I cannot do this myself because I am presently livingin a Western European Country and my Status here isthat of a Political Refugee and moreover I do not wantthe Government of my Country to know aboutthe money because they will believe I got the moneyfrom my brother while he was still in office asPresident. Once you confirm the receipt of the money,I would leave where I am presently located and comeover with my Children to your Country to start a newlife with my Family.As soon as payment is effected, and the amountmentioned above is successfully transferred into youraccount, I intend to use my own share in acquiringsome estates in your country. For this purpose also,you shall be my project manager for the properties Ihope to acquire in your country and you will be paidbased on a certain percentage agreed upon by both ofus.For now, let all our communication be by e-mailbecause of the nature of this transaction but for moredetails on this transaction you can contact my lawyer(Bar Harry Fenadez) on this tel number 0031-630-674-930.It is very important you contact him because he will bethe one to represent me in all legal matters to back thispending transaction since i cannot move at the momemt. Please send me your Telephone and Fax numbers as itwould be better for me to get to you now by any ofthis means. This would be for our better peace of mindbefore and after these funds are transferred into youraccount.The reason why it took this long to get to you wasbecause of the Security Firm's agreement with me whichwas that my brother must personally sign the Power ofAttorney that would transfer title to the prospectivebeneficiary. It was a long wait but it has now paidoff. His excellency, Chun Doo-Hwan does not want to bepersonally involved for security and personal reasons.Your quick response will be highly appreciated. Thankyou in anticipation of your cooperation.Yours faithfully,JANG DOO-HWAN   --b60f7216-d4dc-44c9-940c-ac95f2bc72af--"

"Kindest Attention:My name is Mr. Simon Robson. I am from Portugal .  I have been diagnosedwith Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, andright now I have only about a few months to live, according to medicalexperts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never reallycared for anyone (not even myself)but my business.  Though I am very rich,I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused onmy business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret allthis as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have ormake all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a secondchance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from howI have lived it.Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my propertyand assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as fewclose friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, Ihave decided to give alms to charity organizations and those in Need, as Iwant this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I haveDistributed money to some charity organizations when I was well. Now thatmy health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. Ionce asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distributethe money which I have there to charity organization in United States,Asia, Middle East & Europe, they refused and kept the money to themselves.Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended withwhat I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of isthe huge cash deposit of Twenty Million United States Dollars ($20, 000,000.00) that I have with an Asset Management / Vaulting Company Abroad. Iwill want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charityorganizations and use it to help those in Need.N/B:Kindly note that  40% of this funds must go to  victims of Tsunami,Hurricane Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake , 55% toother Charity Organizations around the World and 5%  for your effort andtime.I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I amusing my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond tothis e-mail if you are interested in carrying out this assignment on mybehalf.God be with you.Mr. Simon Robson."

"Since we got this information about his death and on furtherinvestigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered thatMr. Raymond Beck did not declare any kin or relations inallhis official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperworkin my Bank. This sum of US$12,000,000.00 is still sittingin my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with theprincipal sum at the end of each year.No one will ever comeforward to claim it.According to Laws of United Arab Emirates, at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money willrevert to the ownership of the ( U.A.E ) Government ifnobody applies to claim the fund.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Raymond Beck so that the fruitsof this old man's labor will not get into the hands ofsome corrupt government officials.This is simple, I will like you to provide immediatelyyour full names and address so that the attorney willprepare the necessary documents and affidavits thatwill put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the services of an attorney for draftingand notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessarydocuments and letter of probate/administration in yourfavor for the transfer.

"MagazineThe Power GridBack From the Death Panel How the public option helped by a congressman looking for an issue and a shrewdly silent White Housereturned from the brink.â¢Published Oct 11 2009On the night last week when much of Washington was joyously weeping over the seal of approval bestowed on the Baucus health-carebill by the Congressional Budget Office Anthony Weiner was in his quarters in the Rayburn Building merrily pissing all over thelegislation instead. ""It's just too weak"" he told me. ""It doesn't do enough It doesn't achieve real cost savings. There's no realcompetition. It's pretty much a wish list for the insurance companies."" And those were merely Weiner's substantive criticisms of thebill. His political assessment was even harsher: ""It's effectively dead"" he said. Not a droplet of Weiner's dismissal of the Baucusplan came as any sort of shock; he's been trashing the Senate Finance Committee's efforts for weeks. What's surprising is that anyonegives a fig what Weiner has to say about the topic in the first place. Until six months ago after all the congressman was known morefor his yearning to acquire the keys to Gracie Mansion than his mastery of the arcana of Medicare reimbursement rates. In fact asWeiner would be the first to admit his interest in knowledge of and record on health-care reform were perilously close tononexistent. And yet since May when he concluded that taking on Mike Bloomberg was a challenge that went beyond the Sisypheaninto the realm of the just plain silly Weiner has emerged as one of the few real stars in the marathon health-care debate: the clearestand savviest (and as always loudest and noodgiest) voice in favor of the public option. And though it's plain that whatever billeventually lands on Barack Obama's deskâand yes I think the odds are now close to overwhelming that a big pile of health-carepaper will wind up thereâwon't be anything close to Weiner's single-payer dream his role in framing the terms of the discussion hasbeen more than salutary. In some non-obvious ways you could argue that it's been essential. I should confess at the outset that I havea long-standing soft spot for Weiner whom I first met more than twenty years ago when he was a budding Chuck Schumer protÃ©gÃ©and we played on the same Capitol Hill softball team. Weiner then was strikingly similar to Weiner now: amped-up ambitiouswicked smart forever gauging all the angles unafraid of being (actually proud of being) a royal pain in the tuchis. All the qualities inother words that have served him so well in the wrangle over health care. Weiner describes his efflorescence on the subject as amatter of opportunism in the best sense of the word. ""This was one of those unusual issues where we really didn't have a mother shipthat was directing the message and that created an entrepreneurial environment"" he says. ""You didn't have the president out therespeaking clearly about what he wanted. And among my colleagues there weren't people that jumped out who either had a comfortwith the material or weren't intimidated by the blowback"" Weiner laughs. ""Frankly I like the blowback. After my thirteenth town-hall meeting someone on my staff said 'I can't tell if you're a sadist or a masochist.â Weiner is right about the nature of the vacuumthat he smartly stepped in to fill but there are at least two other proximate causes for it that should be added to his list: the illness anddeath of Ted Kennedy and the migration of Hillary Clinton out of the Senate and into Foggy Bottom which deprived the debate ofwhat would have been its two dominant liberal protagonists. For Weiner Clinton's absence and its implications carry a personal twist;he is engaged to Huma Abedin Hillary's longtime personal aide. ""It's a weird irony that I'm kind of part of the family now and thishas become my issue"" Weiner says. ""If Hillary had stayed in the Senate I would never have had this opening."" Weiner allows thathe's discussed the health-care battle with Clinton; what she's told him he will not say. But one imagines she approves of thecleverness and chutzpa he's displayedâespecially in drawing an explicit analogy between the public option and Medicare anequation that not only increases support for the proposal among voters but flushes out the phoniness of the Republican howls against a""government takeover"" of health care. And one similarly imagines Madame Secretary's chagrin at watching the Obama White Housepursue a dance-of-the-seven-veils strategy explicitly designed to be the antithesis of the one she employed back in 1993 and1994. Weiner's view of the administration's approach hasn't exactly been approvingâa point he's made abundantly and consistentlyclear over the past months. On the eve of Obama's September speech before a joint session of Congress Weiner cracked that ""up tonow the messaging from the White House has been done by Sybil ... They seem to have a different perspective on this every coupleof hours."" And he's apparently had no change of heart. ""The president has been a miserable messenger on this by and large"" he tellsme.Such criticisms haven't gone unnoticed at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in no small part because Weinerâin a testament to hisconsistency lunacy inability to shut up or all threeâhasn't shied away from making them directly. Indeed on a recent flight back toWashington from New York on Air Force One I'm told by one congressman who witnessed the scene Weiner got into a testy"

See the story below. Consensus recommendation is that you call PR and MM tomorrow or Wednesday. Because weexpect them both to go to the press after they speak with you we believe it would be best for you to keep the calls at avery high level. Essentially:O Two months have passed since your trip to Belfast and you're checking in;â¢ You're concerned about the news reports;O You understand that there are substantive differences and frayed nerves but you want to encourage all partiesto take positive actions and avoid unhelpful ones;â¢ You remain prepared to assist in any way â you are personally invested in seeing them work through to thecompletion of this process;â¢ Declan is hard at work but his efforts are hampered by the lack of progress and the public conflictYou would be mostly in listening mode and wouldn't engage substantively on the issues that are dividing them â parades(Sinn Fein doesn't want to concede anything on parades without a date for devolution) and a date (DUP doesn't want toset a date until they get progress on parades).If you're amenable we-can move forward and schedule the calls.ThanksJake

See the report below: Pinera has announced his support.I had a long conversation with Craig a little while ago. He spoke with a number of people in Chile including his closefriendAccording to Craig Pinera had made the calculation that it would be politically untenable to dump Insulza. Apparentlythere is a coalition leadership in the lower house and Insulza's party Concertacion controls the upper house. So he hadno choice.That said Craig believes that his clear message had an impact on what Pinera told Insulza. He apparently gave hissupport with two conditions: (1) don't interfere in Chilean politics and (2) take the democratization agenda seriouslyand don't carry the ALBA countries' water.Craig also said that Arturo had been effective in making clear that the jury was out on Insulza in Washington -- that hadan impact on the Pinera government and reinforced their second message to him.Bottom line: Craig said we couldn't have talked Pinera off of this but we helped drive a stronger set of conditions onPinera's support.

"Dear Sir/madam, It is with trust and believe that I write to you. I am BarristerEDWARD SMITH, a Solicitor at Law. I am the personal attorney to  william cole a National of your Country, who used to work with Shell Development Company here in Nigeria On the 21st of April 2001, my client, his wife and their only daughter were involved in a car accident along apongbon express road ogun state. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost there lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of my clients extended relatives, this hasalso proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track his last name over the Internet, to locate any member of his family hence I contacted you. I have contacted you to assist in recovering the fund valued at US$15.4 Million left behind by my client before it gets confisicated or declared unserviceable by the Security Finance Firm where this huge amount were deposited. The said Security Finance Company has issued me a notice to provide the Next of Kin or have the account confisicated within the next twenty one official working days. Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the relatives for over 2 years now, I seek the consent to present you as the Next of Kin to the deceased since you bear his last names, so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to you. Therefore, on receipt of your positive response, we shall then discuss the sharing ratio and modalities for transfer. I have all necessary information and legal documents needed to back you up for claim. All I require from you is your honest cooperation to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee you that this will be executed under legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. I would be grateful if this mail will be favoured with an early reply.

"Good day, This might seem very deplorable for a person that you do not know. My name is Clement Apute,I am a lawyer and a very close confidant to my client who also happens to be my sister-in-law. I am contacting you because of the my client's urgent need to go into partnership with someone,who is not from this country, as a result of their family's present situation in the country,and specifically because you have a fixed address or let me say fixed responsibilities, which can stands as a good reason to go into partnership with you. The present situation right now, requires good understanding and a good sense of judgment.My sister-in-law and her entire family are really suffering from the hands of some wicked people who are drunk with power.This is just a personal vendetta by the head of states, because he was jailed by my client husband's regime in 1997, for actually plotting a coup d 'etat against their military administration then, when they were in power. It is very clear that our present head of states wants to take advantage of his seat in power to settle his personal hatred for my client's family.This man is bent on destroying my client's family. The family has virtually lost all their family's money and properties due to this vindictive administration in power now. who are bent on dealing with the family.All their bank accounts have been frozen,assets and their properties which I helped in managing have been confiscated and are still non functional till this present day. His administration has spread so much rumors against their family, which is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly to frustrate, humiliate, dismember and widen the scope ofhatred to my client's family. Right now it is completely impossible for any member of the family to make any move because the entire family are being placed under traveling restrictions.About a few months ago we were squished out of another US$395 million dollars, and these wicked people have completely dammed the fact that all this funds can be ascertained for independently. Presently, the family is finding it very hard to manage as we have completely run out of resources, because everything has been taken away from madam and her children. My client needs sombody that she can confide in,presently the family still has some amounts of money to the sum of 84 million US dollars and some fractions in cash,which the family has spread out and lodged in the vault of different Securities outfits in two countries there in Asia and also in Europe.The existence of these monies is not in any way known to anybody else,not even all mama's children, apart from her eldest son. The money was lodged in as jewelry. This is a precaution to maintain a very high level secrecy, because this is all the family have left to fall back on. So we expect you to keep this matter in confidence.Madam wants a partner to proceed as soon as possible and retrieve some money lodged in any of this security outfits and handle it as duly instructed. The family needs somebody to help them withdraw there deposits because the family is financially down here in the country, since everything they own here have been taken away from them. We are looking for an understanding partner that can work with us. All we require from you is to help the familyto go and retrieve any one of the family's deposits that is lodged in one of these places and keep safely in your care, since none of us is able to travel out of this country due to traveling restrictions.Secondly,so that you can always withdraw little part out of their money that will be in your possession and send it down here to us here,anytime the family is in great need. In this way they can continue to sustain the family until they are free from thier enemies. As their lawyer i will be instructing, on how you will go about that. We will be providing you withall the legal documents to make claim on behalf of my client. Please be rest assured that you will have no problems or difficulties in claiming any of these deposits because nobody is aware of the existence of this money. All the details will be given to you when we open up negotiations and arrive at a reasonable compromise and until I gain your trust to see that we can work together. We will negotiate on a certain percentage share of the money that the family will offer to you for your expected assistance and partnership. Please do inform me on your decision immediately, so as to stop further contacts. I await your response. NOTE - You can also get in contact with me via my securedemail:clem-aputa@earthling.net I will like to have your private phone number so that we can discuss better. Regards, Clement Apute. Esq. "

Furthermore, as his attorney, I am aware that he did not declare any nextof kin or relations in all his official documents, including his DepositoryForm with the Finance House.According to Nigerian Law, at the expirationof 3 (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the NigerianGovernment if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Nothing muchhas happened vis a vis Russian women and US engagement since your efforts in the 90's so we are attempting to restartare relationship with them .They been going backwards in terms of progress.I'm attaching the email I sent Jake and Kurt on the NZ and Australian initiatives.Have a good trip.
They are working on it. Eikenberry spoke with Karzai tonight and delivered a tough message. He will meet with Karzaiand Eide in am. We have only best guesses on where the plane is at the moment.
Assume you're in Berlin. Holbrooke just dazzled & in some key cases mollified even persuaded Trilateral Commission reAfpak. It was off-record.

"Hello,I wish to accost you with a request that would be of immense benefit to both of us. Being an executor of wills, it is possible that we may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations, when we cannot help it, or left with no better option. The issue I am presenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS. WEBSITE.http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm. I am now faced with confusion of who to pass the fortune to.According to the English law, the fortune is supposed to be bequeathed to the government,if nobody comes forward as the next of kin within seven years of the demise of the benefactor of the will. My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the beneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the legacy of $7million, which my deceased client  bequeathed to his next-of-kin. For now, I alone know about his will, as my client had great confidence in me.Everything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for you and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the tsunami victims,as this is my primary objective. All I have to do is amend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the $7million legacy.Again, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider this amount too big for you to defend. It does not matter, as there are documents to back it up. This is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-kin. As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I prefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being disbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of the oath of the English Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the sensitivity of this issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its confidentiality. I therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with anybody, even if you decline my request.I look forward to hearing from you soon.Yours trulyStephen Ayling.     "

">From Mr. Thompson J. AlberDear Friend,  I sincerely hope that after you read this mail you will respond to my call, let me start by introducing myself my name is Thompson J. Alber. I am 70 years old, a British living in West Africa. I am a businessman and own two companies here in Ouagadougou, married with two children. My wife and two children died in a car accident six years ago but before this happened my business and concern for making money was all I lived for I never really cared about other values in life but since the loss of my family, I have found a new desire to assist helpless families.   I have been helping orphans in motherless homes, I have donated some money to orphans in Sudan, America and some Asian countries. Before I became ill, I kept some money, Ten million,three hundred thousand dollars (US$10.3million) to be precise in a long term deposit account in a Bank.  Presently, I'm in a hospital my doctor told me I have prostate cancer that I have a few months to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations. Because so much of my wealth has been plundered by relatives and friends since my illness, hence I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them since the money in the Bank is the last fund that I have left. Right now I am partially stranded in the hospital due to the nature of my sickness so I am appealing to you to help me collect the deposit from the Bank and distribute it amongst charity organizations.  I would want you to use your discretion to distribute the money and keep 20% of it for yourself. Feel free to reimburse yourself when you have the money for any cost you might have incurred during the process of collecting and distributing the money to charity organizations. May the good Lord bless you and your family. if you are interested to proceed with this project go ahead and forward the below information so that I will instruct you on how to proceed:Your Full Names:Your Direct Telephone Number:Your Fax:Your Occupation:Your Nationality:Your Age: Please reply to this mail as I can only communicate through my laptop which is by my bed, as soon as I get the above listed information, I shall then give you the necessary information you need to collect this money. God bless you. Mr. Thompson J. Alber."

This is whereI need to employ your assistance and service.WHAT I NEED YOU FOR?At this point, I will be glad if you could work with me as myrepresentative in the US. You will be working as my payment assistantincharge of collecting and processing the payments from my Associates.Since they will be making the payment in Money orders/ Cashier checksmade payable only in the US, you will be collecting this payments andcashing them on my behalf.

My mother died on the 20th october 1988 and my father took me so special because l am motherless. </DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Before the death of my father on 29th november 2003 in a private hospital here in Abidjan, he secretly called me on his bedside,when I sat down to listen to him, he started crying, why? (1) He complained that I am too young to be managing my life with no one to take care of me,(2)That I have not finished my university education as he planned for me, he revealed to me that he has a sum of US$8.400.000.(EIGHT MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) left in a security company here in Abidjan, that he used my name as the only daughter for his next of kin in deposit of the funds. </DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>He also explained to me that it was because of this wealth that he was poisioned by his business associates , that l should seek for a GOD fearing foreign partner in a country of my choice where l will transfer this money and use it for proper investment purpose ,that I must finish my university education by the help of a business partner abroad,that he or she should help me obtain a resident permit in his or her country.He also gave a standing instrution to the company that the<BR>deposit must be transferred outside this country. According to my father,the money was deposited as art works to avoid attracting attention to the deposit. </DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Sir, I am now ready to do all these since my father my bread winner is no more. Sir l am honourable seeking your assistance in the following ways. </DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>(1) To serve as my guardian in your country while I will depend on your expert advise since l am a girl of 23 years.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>(2) To make arrangement for me to come over to your country in order to further my university education and to secure a residential permit for me in your country.</DIV><DIV><BR>Moreover sir, l am willing to offer you 15% of the total sum as compensation for your assistance in the transfer of this deposit to your country. Furthermore, you can indicate your option towards assisting me as l believed that this project would be concluded within seven days you signify interest to assist me by contacting the security company. </DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Hoping to hearing from you soon. May God bless you as you extend your helping hand to the needy.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Best wishes</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Lilian Thomas. </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><p>		<hr size=1> <a href=""http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/_ylc=X3oDMTFqODRtdXQ4BF9TAzMyOTc1MDIEX3MDOTY2ODgxNjkEcG9zAzEEc2VjA21haWwtZm9vdGVyBHNsawNmYw--/SIG=110oav78o/**http%3a//farechase.yahoo.com/"">Yahoo!

"STRICTLY CONFIDENTIALMy dear Friend, I am highly compelled upon strict recommendation, to write you this very urgent and confidential letter.I do hope my letter will not embarrass yousince I had no previous correspondence with you.I hope this mail will not come to you as a surprise.I am sending this proposal with due sense of humanity, responsibility andwith few awareness that you will give it a sympathetic attention. I regreet the inconvenience it may cause you base on the condition that we have not met before. I am Mrs. Salatu Mustapha, the wife of Al Mustapha, personal assistant to the Late head of state of Federal Republic of Nigeria - General Sani Abacha.I am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other like wise developing a cordial relationship.My husband along with the head of state and top officials of their past administration has been accused of looting several Billion United States Dollars from the Nigeria Government. The current attitude of the present government towards my family has indeed made life quite unbearable for us.Fortunately, Al Mustapha my Husband has Six million and eight hundred thousand United States Dollars(US$6.8 million) cash, which he intended to use for investment purposes overseas. This money is kept in a private security company. This money was deposited for safe keeping in the security vault of a freighting agency here by my husband preparotry to being air lifted abroad for investment purposes before his arrest leaving a clause that it could only be claimed by an expertriate partner. It is only my husband and myself that know where the money is kept. Due to the current situation in the country concerning governmentï¿½s vendettas towards my family, we seek your assistance to transfer this money out of Nigeria for the purpose of investment as intended by my husband.Note that my family is currently being probed by this present government for alleged involvement in misappropriation of public funds during their regime.Towards this effect, an embargo restricting my family members from traveling or carrying outfinancial transactions without their express permission is in force.Right now, my husband (Al Mustapha) is under arrest and is being detained inconnection to the above and other activities of his late Boss.However, I have an arrangement on how to freight this money to you after receiving some assurances from you of the safety our own share and that you will only take the commission that we will offer you.This money personally belongs to my husband and he intends that it still be used for investment. No record ever existed concerning this money, neither is the money traceable by the government because thereis no Documentation concerning the funds in the Federal Treasury. The freighting company to be used has now been introduced to me and as soon as we recieve your readiness to assist us recieve this fund we shall formalize the deposit documents in your name and reach an agreement withthem to air lift the consignment for your pick up.Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, we propose a commission of 15%(Fifteen Percent) of the total sum to you for the expected services and assistance. While 5% is mapped outfor miscellaneous expenses.On your positive consent, I shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss about this.Your urgent response is highly needed. I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential, while I await your prompt response.Best regards,MRS.

"Cheryl Mills <Sunday December 6 2009 9:39 PMFwd: Charles Blow in NYT todayEF1December 5 2009Op-Ed ColumnistBlack in the Age of ObamaBy CHARLES M. BLOWA hundred and fifty years ago Charles Dickens opened ""A Tale of Two Cities"" with the now-famous phrase:""It was the best of times it was the worst of times. ...""Those words resonated with me recently while contemplating the impact of the Obama presidency on blacks inAmerica. So far it's been mixed. Blacks are living a tale of two Americas â one of the ascension of the firstblack president with the cultural capital that accrues; the other of a collapsing quality of life and amplified racialtensions while supporting a president who is loath to even acknowledge their pain let alone commiserate in it.Last year blacks dared to dream anew envisioning a future in which Obama's election would be the catalyst foran era of prosperity and more racial harmony. Now that the election's afterglow has nearly faded the hysteria ofhope is being ground against the hard stone of reality. Things have not gotten better. In many ways they'vegotten worse.The recession for one has dealt a particularly punishing and uneven hand to blacks.A May report from the Pew Research Center found that blacks were the most likely to get higher-pricedsubprime loans leading to higher foreclosure rates. In fact blacks have displaced Hispanics as the group withthe lowest homeownership rates.According to the most recent jobs data not only is the unemployment rate for blacks nearly twice that of whitesthe gap in some important demographics has widened rapidly since Obama took office. The unemployment rateover that time for white college graduates under 24 years old grew by about 20 percent. For their black cohortsthe rate grew by about twice that much.And a report published last month by the Department of Agriculture found that in 2008 ""food insecurity"" forAmerican households had risen to record levels with black children being the most likely to experience thatfood insecurity.Things on the racial front are just as bad.We are now inundated with examples of overt racism on a scale to which we are unaccustomed. Any protesterwith a racist poster can hijack a news cycle while a racist image can live forever on the Internet. In fact raciallyoffensive images of the first couple are so prolific online that Google now runs an apologetic ad with the resultsof image searches of them.And it's not all words and images; it's actions as well. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's 2008hate crimes data released last week anti-black hate crimes rose 4 percent from 2007 while the combined hatecrimes against all other racial categories declined 11 percent. If you look at the two-year trend which wouldinclude Obarna's ascension as a candidate anti-black hate crimes have risen 8 percent while those against theother racial groups have fallen 19 percent.This has had a sobering effect on blacks. According to a Nov. 9 report from Gallup last summer 23 percent ofblacks thought that race relations would get a lot better with the election of Obama. Now less than half thatpercentage says that things have actually gotten a lot better.The racial animosity that Obama's election has stirred up may have contributed to a rallying effect amongblacks. According to a Gallup report published on Nov. 24 Obama's approval rating among whites has droppedto 39 percent but among blacks it remains above 90 percent.Also this hasn't exactly been a good year for black men in the news. Plaxico Burress was locked up foraccidentally shooting off a gun in a club. Henry Louis Gates Jr. was locked up for intentionally shooting off hismouth at his own home. And Michael Jackson died after being shot full of propofol. Chris Brown brutally beatRihanna. Former Representative William Jefferson was convicted. And most recently the ""personal failings"" ofTiger Woods portray him as an alley cat. Meanwhile the most critically acclaimed black movie of the year""Precious"" features a black man who rapes and twice impregnates his own daughter. Rooting for the presidentfeels like a nice counterbalance.However the rallying creates a conundrum for blacks: how to air anxiety without further arming Obama'senemies. This dilemma has rendered blacks virtually voiceless on some pressing issues at a time when theirvoices would have presumably held greater sway.This means that Obama can get away with doing almost nothing to specifically address issues important toAfrican-Americans and instead focus on the white voters he's losing in droves. This has not gone unnoticed. Inthe Nov. 9 Gallup poll the number of blacks who felt that Obama would not go far enough in promoting effortsto aid the black community jumped 60 percent from last summer to now.The hard truth is that Obama needs white voters more than he needs black ones.According to my analysis even if every black person in America had stayed home on Election Day Obamawould still be president. To a large degree Obama was elected by white people some of whom were more ableto accept him because he consciously portrayed himself as racially ambiguous.In fact commiserating with the blacks could prove politically problematic.In a study to be published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences this monthresearchers asked subjects to rate images of the president to determine which ones best represented his ""trueessence."" In some of the photos his skin had been lightened. In others it had been darkened. The result? Themore people identified him with the ""whiter"" images the more likely they were to have voted for him and viceversa.The Age of Obama so far at least seems less about Obama as a black community game-changer than as aWhite House gamesman. It's unclear if there will be a positive Obama Effect but an Obama Backlash isincreasingly apparent. Meanwhile black people are also living a tale of two actions: grin and bear it.Forwarded message"

"Attention pleaseCompliments to you; I sincerely apologize for the intrude into your private= life, however I have a serious project which I believe would be of interes=t to you and for this reason I reached out to you. I am Barrister Kenneth O=bi. I worked as an attorney to an Oil Servicing company {CEDRY INCORPORATED=} from 1980 to 1996 when the company liquidated. Cedry liquidated and folde=d as a result of mismanagement and feud amongst the directors. On the 11th =of June 1986, the company secretary and I took a LIFE ASSURANCE POLICY for =the Chairman of the company for a period of TWENTY YEARS, which is from Jun=e 1986 till June 2006. This LIFE POLICY was taken from a reputable Insuranc=e Company here called STANDARD TRUST INSURANCE PLC. The premium for this Li=fe policy was paid upfront by the Cedry because it is a long-term policy.In 1996, Cedry was folded but Standard Trust Insurance Company did not term=inate the Life Policy we took for the Chairman because we did not apply  fo=r cancellation or termination of the Policy. On December 2006, I got a lett=er from Standard Trust Insurance notifying me that the LIFE POLICY we took =for Cedry Chairman was due and that I should come to their office for furth=er discussions. I went to their office and they told me that they have Thre=e Million Dollars accrued over a period of twenty years to pay to the Chair=man of liquidated Cedry as SURRENDER VALUE for the Life Policy the company =took for him. The Insurance Company knew that Cedry was folded and they ask=ed me to provide the Chairman or his relative to receive the money.Since 2006 till date I have searched for the Chairman without success. I we=nt back to tell the Insurance Company that the Chairman is very old and sen=ile to the extent that his sight is very bad and that he cannot do anything= for himself as he is almost a vegetable. The Insurance Company told me to =get any of  the Chairman=92s relative with his authorization to claim the s=urrender value for him. I have resolved to get any person or any person bea=ring same name as the Chairman to stand as his relative to receive the surr=ender value. If we don't claim this money,  no one would and the money woul=d be retained in the coffers of the Insurance Company as their profit. I fe=el it is rather appropriate that we team up and claim this money and use so=me percentage of it to help the poor and the less privilege in our society =than allow the Insurance Company to retain it as profit.I contacted you in trust believing that you will not run away with the mone=y if it enters your account. The Insurance Company have very high respect a=nd regards for me and will be obliged to released the Surrender Value to wh=oever I present to them as heir to the Chairman. I will obtain for you all =that is required to execute this transaction successfully. I have in my fil=e some documents for the existence of the Cedry and the Life Policy. I will= send to you once you indicate your interest. I will also send a claim appl=ication specimen to you, which you will fill and send to the Insurance Comp=any for the release of the surrender value to your account. Your share for =assisting in this transaction will be One Million Dollars. If you cannot ex=ecute this transaction for any reason, please introduce someone who is capa=ble and I will reward you with Fifty thousand dollars after the transaction=. Reply urgently if you are interested to execute this with me.

GatesHe advances a powerful vision of integrated civilian power w/ State and USAID under you in his Foreign Affairs article. Idon't think you need to get into the State/AID details w/ him but it wd be great to give him a heads up that you thinkthat the PSD as written moves toward 3 separate pillars of defense development and diplomacy rather than reinforcingthe integrated power frame of the Nat. Security Strategy. AM
