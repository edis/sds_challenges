    "\n",
    "Welcome Data Scientist to the 6th SDS Club Monthly Challenge! In this month's challenge you will be helping hospitals and medical centers to determine whether a patient will show up for their appointment. Close to 20% of patients worldwide miss their appointments, this costs medical providers millions of dollars annually. Your mission to help predict whether a given patient will show-up to their appointment."
