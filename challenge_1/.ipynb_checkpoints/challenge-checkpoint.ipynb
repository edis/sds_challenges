    "Welcome, Data Scientist! You have recently been hired by the US Department of Transportation (DOT) to analyze data from multiple airline carriers in the United States. The DOT wants to help airline carriers reduce the number of flight cancellations and improve travelers' experiences. Your job is to help the DOT predict whether or not a flight will be canceled based on the data provided."
